## Emergency Scenarios

### 1. Compromised Wallet

**Symptoms:**
- Unauthorized transactions from your wallet
- Unexpected token approvals
- Wallet drained or funds missing
- Suspicious activity on block explorer

**Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes):**

<div className="fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step">

#### Stop Using the Wallet
Do not make any more transactions from the compromised wallet.

#### Create New Wallet
On a secure device, create a new wallet immediately:
- Use a hardware wallet if possible
- Or create new MetaMask wallet on clean device

#### Transfer Remaining Funds
If there are still funds in the compromised wallet:

```bash
# Priority order:
1. Transfer MUSD first (most liquid)
2. Withdraw from all pools immediately
3. Transfer any other tokens
4. Send any remaining ETH/native tokens
```

#### Revoke All Approvals
Go to [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) and revoke ALL approvals on the compromised wallet.

</div>

**Next Steps (< 24 hours):**

1. **Document Everything**
   - Screenshot all unauthorized transactions
   - Note timestamps and amounts
   - Save transaction hashes
   - Record wallet addresses involved

2. **Scan for Malware**
   - Run full antivirus scan
   - Check browser extensions
   - Review recent downloads
   - Consider reformatting device

3. **Report the Incident**
   - Email support@khipuvault.com with details
   - Report to wallet provider (MetaMask, etc.)
   - File police report if large amount stolen
   - Report scam addresses to block explorers

4. **Security Audit**
   - Review how wallet was compromised
   - Update all passwords
   - Enable 2FA everywhere possible
   - Review seed phrase storage

**Prevention for Future:**

✅ Use hardware wallet for large amounts
✅ Keep seed phrase offline and secure
✅ Never share private keys
✅ Verify URLs before connecting wallet
✅ Use dedicated device for crypto

### 2. Phishing Attack

**Symptoms:**
- You signed a transaction you don't recognize
- Clicked a suspicious link
- Entered seed phrase on a website
- Received urgent "security alert" email

**If You Entered Seed Phrase on Phishing Site:**

<Callout type="error" title="CRITICAL: Act Immediately">
Your wallet is compromised. Funds will be stolen within minutes.
</Callout>

**Immediate Actions (< 2 minutes):**

1. **Transfer ALL funds** to a new wallet NOW
2. **Do not delay** - attackers work fast
3. **Skip revocations** - no time, just move funds

**After Funds Are Safe:**

1. Never use the compromised wallet again
2. Report the phishing site:
   - [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/)
   - [MetaMask Phishing Detector](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect)
   - security@khipuvault.com

**If You Signed a Malicious Transaction:**

1. **Check what you approved:**
   - Go to [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash)
   - Review recent approvals
   - Look for unlimited approvals

2. **Revoke immediately:**
   - Revoke the malicious approval
   - Revoke ALL unlimited approvals
   - Monitor for unauthorized transactions

3. **Transfer funds** to new wallet if approval was high-value

**If You Just Clicked a Link (didn't sign anything):**

1. **Don't panic** - clicking alone doesn't compromise wallet
2. **Don't enter any information** on the site
3. **Close the tab** immediately
4. **Scan for malware** - run antivirus
5. **Monitor your wallet** for next 24 hours

**Prevention:**

✅ Always verify URLs before connecting
✅ Bookmark official sites
✅ Read transaction details before signing
✅ Never enter seed phrase on any website
✅ Be suspicious of urgent messages

- 404 or 500 errors

**Don't Panic - Your Funds Are Safe:**

<Callout type="success">
Your Bitcoin is in smart contracts on the blockchain, NOT on our website. Even if our website is permanently offline, your funds are safe and accessible.
</Callout>

**Immediate Steps:**

1. **Check if it's just you:**
   - Try different browser
   - Try different device
   - Try mobile data (not WiFi)
   - Check [DownDetector](https://downdetector.com)

2. **Check official status:**
   - Status page: [status.khipuvault.com](https://status.khipuvault.com)
   - Twitter: [@KhipuVault](https://twitter.com/khipuvault)
   - Discord: [discord.gg/khipuvault](https://discord.gg/khipuvault)

3. **Try backup access:**
   - IPFS gateway: [khipuvault.ipfs.io](https://khipuvault.ipfs.io) (planned)
   - Direct contract interaction (see below)

**Direct Contract Interaction:**

If the website is down, you can still withdraw directly:

**Option 1: Using Etherscan/Block Explorer**

```
1. Go to Mezo Block Explorer: explorer.test.mezo.org
2. Search for your pool contract address:
   - IndividualPool: 0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393
   - CooperativePool: 0x323FcA9b377fe29B8fc95dDbD9Fe54cea1655F88
3. Click "Write Contract"
4. Connect your wallet
5. Find "withdraw" function
6. Enter amount (in wei: amount × 10^18)
7. Click "Write" and confirm transaction
```

**Option 2: Using Foundry Cast**

```bash
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Withdraw from IndividualPool
cast send 0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393 \
  "withdraw(uint256)" 1000000000000000000 \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.test.mezo.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY

# Check your balance
cast call 0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393 \
  "balanceOf(address)" $YOUR_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.test.mezo.org
```

**Option 3: Using ethers.js**

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.test.mezo.org');
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

const poolABI = ['function withdraw(uint256 amount)'];
const pool = new ethers.Contract(POOL_ADDRESS, poolABI, wallet);

// Withdraw 1000 MUSD
await pool.withdraw(ethers.parseEther('1000'));
```

### 6. Suspicious Activity Detected

   - Connect wallet
   - Review all token approvals
   - Revoke anything suspicious

3. **Review Pool Memberships:**
   - Log into KhipuVault

### 7. Lost Access to Wallet

**Scenarios:**

#### Lost Device (but have seed phrase)

✅ **You CAN recover:**

1. Get new device
2. Install wallet software (MetaMask, hardware wallet)
3. Select "Import using seed phrase"
4. Enter your 12/24 word seed phrase
5. Verify funds are restored

#### Lost Seed Phrase (but have device)

⚠️ **Partial recovery possible:**

1. **Transfer funds NOW** to new wallet
2. Create new wallet on secure device
3. Transfer ALL funds from old to new wallet
4. Never use old wallet again (can't recover if device is lost)

#### Lost Both Device and Seed Phrase

❌ **Cannot recover:**

Unfortunately, your funds are **permanently lost**. No one (including us) can recover them.

**Prevention:**
- ✅ Backup seed phrase in multiple secure locations
- ✅ Use fireproof/waterproof storage
- ✅ Tell trusted person where backups are (in case of emergency)
- ✅ Consider metal seed phrase backup

### 8. Gas Price Spike

**Symptoms:**
- Transaction costs extremely high
- Wallet shows $50+ for simple transaction
- All transactions timing out

**What to Do:**

1. **Wait if Not Urgent:**
   - Gas prices fluctuate
   - Check [Mezo Gas Tracker](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
   - Wait for network to calm down

2. **Adjust Gas Settings:**
   ```
   In MetaMask:
   1. Click transaction
   2. Click "Edit" on gas
   3. Select "Low" priority
   4. Wait longer for confirmation
   ```

3. **Time Your Transactions:**
   - Avoid peak hours (US/EU business hours)
   - Early morning (UTC) usually cheaper
   - Weekends sometimes quieter

**Emergency Withdrawal During High Gas:**

If you MUST withdraw during high gas:

1. Withdraw maximum amount (not multiple small withdrawals)
2. Use "Fast" gas setting
3. Batch operations if possible
4. Accept higher cost as emergency fee
