❌ Social engineering attacks
❌ Physical security
❌ Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
❌ Spam or social media account takeover

## Reward Tiers

Rewards are based on severity and impact using the OWASP Risk Rating:

### Critical Severity: $5,000 - $10,000

**Examples:**
- Direct theft of user funds from contracts
- Permanent freezing of funds
- Unauthorized minting of tokens
- Critical smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, integer overflow, etc.)

### High Severity: $2,000 - $5,000

**Examples:**
- Temporary freezing of funds
- Smart contract griefing (gas DOS, etc.)
- Unauthorized access to sensitive user data
- Authentication bypass allowing fund manipulation

### Medium Severity: $500 - $2,000

**Examples:**
- Smart contract unable to operate without user interaction
- Block gas limit manipulation
- Incorrect calculation of user balances or yields
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) with meaningful impact

### Low Severity: $100 - $500

**Examples:**
- Best practice violations with security implications
- Information disclosure with limited impact
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Missing input validation

### Informational: $0 - $100

**Examples:**
- Code quality improvements
- Gas optimization suggestions
- Documentation errors
- UI/UX issues without security impact

<Callout type="info">
Final reward amount is determined by our security team based on severity, impact, quality of report, and fix complexity.
</Callout>

## Severity Assessment

We use the following framework to assess severity:

### Impact

- **Critical**: Direct loss of funds or complete system compromise
- **High**: Significant loss of funds or major functionality impairment
- **Medium**: Indirect loss of funds or partial functionality impairment
- **Low**: Minimal loss or temporary inconvenience
- **Informational**: No direct impact but worth addressing

### Likelihood

- **High**: Easy to exploit, requires minimal resources
- **Medium**: Moderate difficulty, requires specific conditions
- **Low**: Difficult to exploit, requires significant resources

**Final Severity** = Impact × Likelihood

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for rewards, you must:

✅ **Be the first** to report the vulnerability
✅ **Follow responsible disclosure** (no public disclosure before fix)
✅ **Provide clear reproduction steps** and proof of concept
✅ **Not exploit the vulnerability** beyond proof of concept
✅ **Not access or modify** user data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue
✅ **Not perform actions** that could harm KhipuVault or its users
✅ **Comply with all laws** and regulations

### Ineligible Submissions

We will NOT reward:

❌ Duplicate reports (first reporter wins)
❌ Known issues already disclosed or in our backlog
❌ Issues found in third-party code (report to original project)

## Vulnerability Examples

### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

**Critical Example: Reentrancy Attack**

```solidity
// Vulnerable Pattern (Hypothetical)
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount; // State update AFTER external call
}

// Attack: Reenter withdraw() before balance is updated
```

**Reward**: $8,000 - $10,000 (Critical)

**Medium Example: Gas Griefing**

```solidity
// Vulnerable Pattern (Hypothetical)
function batchProcess(address[] calldata users) external {
    for(uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        // Unbounded loop could hit gas limit
        processUser(users[i]);
    }
}

// Attack: Submit large array to DOS the function
```

**Reward**: $500 - $1,000 (Medium)

### Web Application Vulnerabilities

**High Example: Authentication Bypass**

Finding a way to access user accounts without proper authentication or signature verification.

**Reward**: $3,000 - $5,000 (High)

**Low Example: CSRF**
