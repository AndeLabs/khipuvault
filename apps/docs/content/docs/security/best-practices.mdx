# Security Best Practices

Your security is your responsibility. This guide covers essential best practices to protect your Bitcoin and stay safe while using KhipuVault.

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical: You Control Your Keys">
KhipuVault is non-custodial. We never have access to your private keys. If you lose your keys or get hacked, we cannot recover your funds.
</Callout>

## Wallet Security

### Choose the Right Wallet

**For Large Amounts ($1,000+)**

🔐 **Hardware Wallets** (Most Secure)
- ✅ **Ledger Nano X/S Plus**: Industry standard, proven security
- ✅ **Trezor Model T/One**: Open-source hardware wallet
- ✅ **GridPlus Lattice1**: Advanced features, card-based signing

**Benefits:**
- Private keys never leave the device
- Protected against malware
- Requires physical confirmation for transactions

**Setup Guide:**
1. Buy directly from manufacturer (never from third parties)
2. Verify tamper-evident seals
3. Generate new seed phrase (never use pre-generated)
4. Store seed phrase securely offline
5. Test recovery before depositing large amounts

**For Small Amounts ($100-$1,000)**

💻 **Software Wallets** (Convenient)
- ✅ **MetaMask**: Most popular, well-audited
- ✅ **Rainbow Wallet**: User-friendly, mobile-first
- ✅ **Frame**: Privacy-focused desktop wallet

**Security Tips:**
- Use a dedicated browser profile for crypto
- Enable password protection
- Never use on public WiFi without VPN
- Regularly update the wallet software

**For Testing Only**

🧪 **Testnet Wallets**
- Use separate wallets for testnet
- Never put real funds in testnet wallets
- Clearly label test vs. production wallets

### Seed Phrase Security

Your seed phrase (12-24 words) is the master key to your funds.

<Callout type="error" title="NEVER Share Your Seed Phrase">
Anyone with your seed phrase can steal ALL your funds. No legitimate service will EVER ask for it.
</Callout>

#### ✅ DO:

**Backup Securely**
- ✅ Write on paper or steel (fireproof/waterproof)
- ✅ Store in multiple secure locations (safe, safety deposit box)
- ✅ Consider splitting across multiple locations
- ✅ Use a passphrase (25th word) for additional security
- ✅ Test your backup by restoring a small amount

**Physical Security**
- ✅ Store in fireproof/waterproof container
- ✅ Use tamper-evident bags
- ✅ Consider professional storage (bank vault)

#### ❌ DON'T:

**Digital Storage**
- ❌ Take photos of your seed phrase
- ❌ Store in cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- ❌ Save in password managers
- ❌ Send via email, SMS, or messaging apps
- ❌ Type on any device connected to internet

**Sharing**
- ❌ Share with anyone (family, friends, support)
- ❌ Enter on any website
- ❌ Read aloud in public or on video calls

### Private Key Hygiene

**Create Dedicated Wallets**

Use separate wallets for different purposes:

- 🏦 **Savings Wallet**: Large amounts, hardware wallet
- 💰 **DeFi Wallet**: Active DeFi use, moderate amounts
- 🧪 **Test Wallet**: Trying new protocols, small amounts
- 🎮 **NFT Wallet**: NFTs and gaming, separate from funds

**Never Reuse Wallets**

Once a wallet is compromised or suspicious:
- ✅ Create a new wallet immediately
- ✅ Transfer funds to the new wallet
- ✅ Never use the old wallet again
- ✅ Revoke all approvals on old wallet

**Manage Token Approvals**

Check and revoke unnecessary approvals:

1. Visit [Revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash) or [Etherscan Token Approvals](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Review all approvals
4. Revoke any unlimited or suspicious approvals

<Callout type="info">
Token approvals allow contracts to spend your tokens. Unlimited approvals are a security risk if the contract is compromised.
</Callout>

## Phishing Prevention

Phishing is the #1 way people lose crypto. Stay vigilant.

### Verify URLs

**Official KhipuVault Domains:**

✅ `https://khipuvault.com` - Main website
✅ `https://app.khipuvault.com` - Web app
✅ `https://docs.khipuvault.com` - Documentation
✅ `https://api.khipuvault.com` - API

**Phishing Detection:**

❌ `khipuva1t.com` - Number "1" instead of "l"
❌ `khipuvault.co` - Different TLD
❌ `khipu-vault.com` - Extra hyphen
❌ `khipuvault-app.com` - Unofficial subdomain

**Protection Steps:**

1. **Bookmark the official site** and always use the bookmark
2. **Check for HTTPS** and valid SSL certificate
3. **Verify the exact domain** before connecting wallet
4. **Use a password manager** that auto-fills only on correct domains

### Recognize Phishing Attempts

**Email Phishing**

🚨 **Red Flags:**
- Urgent action required ("Wallet will be locked!")

3. **Compare addresses**: Match exactly (character by character)

**Official Contract Addresses (Mezo Testnet):**

```
IndividualPool:  0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393

### Approve Safely

**Token Approvals**

When approving tokens:

✅ **Approve only the amount needed** (not unlimited)
✅ **Revoke approvals** when done using the protocol
✅ **Check existing approvals** before adding new ones

✅ Don't stay logged in on public devices
✅ Review the SIWE message before signing
✅ Clear browser cache regularly

### Session Management
