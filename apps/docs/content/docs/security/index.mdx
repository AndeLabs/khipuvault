## Our Security Principles

### 1. Non-Custodial Design

You always maintain full control of your Bitcoin. We never hold your private keys or have custody of your funds.

<Callout type="success" title="Your Keys, Your Bitcoin">
KhipuVault smart contracts are designed to ensure you can always withdraw your funds, even if our website goes offline.
</Callout>

### 2. Smart Contract Security

Our smart contracts follow industry best practices:

- ✅ **OpenZeppelin libraries** - Battle-tested security standards
- ✅ **Reentrancy guards** - Protection against reentrancy attacks
- ✅ **Access controls** - Role-based permissions with multi-sig
- ✅ **Pausable contracts** - Emergency stop mechanism
- ✅ **Event logging** - Complete audit trail on-chain
- ✅ **Time-locks** - Delayed execution for sensitive operations

### 3. Multi-Layered Defense

We implement defense in depth:

**Smart Contract Layer**
- Formal verification patterns
- Automated security scanning (Slither, Aderyn)
- Manual code reviews
- Independent audits

**Application Layer**
- SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) authentication
- JWT token security with short expiration
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Input validation with Zod schemas

**Infrastructure Layer**
- Secure RPC endpoints
- Database encryption at rest
- TLS/SSL for all connections
- Regular security updates

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

We actively monitor the platform 24/7:

- Real-time event indexing for unusual activity
- Automated alerts for contract interactions
- Community reporting channels
- Regular security assessments

## Security Guarantees

### What We Guarantee

✅ **Your funds are always yours** - Non-custodial design ensures you maintain control

✅ **Transparent operations** - All contract code is open-source and verified

✅ **Emergency procedures** - Clear protocols for handling security incidents

✅ **Responsible disclosure** - Bug bounty program for responsible vulnerability reporting

### What We Don't Guarantee

⚠️ **Smart contract risks** - While audited, smart contracts can have undiscovered vulnerabilities

⚠️ **Blockchain risks** - Mezo blockchain infrastructure is beyond our control

⚠️ **User error protection** - We cannot recover funds lost due to compromised private keys

⚠️ **Third-party risks** - Wallet providers, RPC nodes, and integrations have their own risks

✅ **Backup your seed phrase** securely offline

✅ **Never share your private keys** with anyone

✅ **Use a dedicated browser profile** for crypto transactions

### Phishing Prevention

⚠️ **Always verify the URL**: Official domain is `khipuvault.com`

⚠️ **Bookmark the official site** to avoid typosquatting

⚠️ **Check contract addresses** before approving transactions

⚠️ **Be wary of DMs** offering support or asking for keys
