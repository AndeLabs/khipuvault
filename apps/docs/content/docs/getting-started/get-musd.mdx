# Get MUSD Test Tokens

To try KhipuVault on testnet, you need **MUSD** (Mezo USD) - a Bitcoin-pegged stablecoin for testing.

<Callout type="success" title="Completely Free">
Testnet tokens are **100% free** and have **no real-world value**. They're perfect for learning and testing KhipuVault without any financial risk!
</Callout>

## What is MUSD?

**MUSD** (Mezo USD) is a stablecoin on the Mezo blockchain:

- 💵 **Pegged to USD** (1 MUSD = ~$1)
- ⛓️ **Backed by Bitcoin** collateral
- 🔒 **Stable value** (doesn't fluctuate like BTC/ETH)
- 🧪 **Testnet version** is free for testing

On mainnet (future), you'll use real MUSD to earn real yields. For now, we're on testnet!

## Get MUSD from Faucet

A "faucet" is a service that gives free testnet tokens. Mezo provides an official faucet:

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### Visit the Mezo Faucet

Go to: [https://faucet.test.mezo.org](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)

### Connect Your Wallet

1. Click "Connect Wallet"
2. Select MetaMask
3. Approve the connection

### Verify Network

Make sure your MetaMask is on **Mezo Testnet**. If not:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Switch to "Mezo Testnet"
3. Refresh the faucet page

### Request Tokens

1. Click "Get MUSD" or "Request Tokens"
2. Wait 10-30 seconds for the transaction to complete
3. Check your MetaMask - you should see MUSD appear!

### Verify Balance

Open MetaMask and verify you have MUSD. You should see:
- **MUSD** in your token list
- Amount: Usually 1,000 MUSD or similar

</div>

<Callout type="info">
**Faucet Limits**: To prevent abuse, faucets usually limit how often you can request tokens (e.g., once per 24 hours per address).
</Callout>

## Add MUSD to MetaMask (If Not Visible)

Sometimes MetaMask doesn't automatically show new tokens. Add MUSD manually:

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### Open MetaMask

Click the extension icon.

### Go to "Tokens"

Click the "Tokens" tab (should be selected by default).

### Click "Import Tokens"

Scroll down and click "Import tokens" or "+ Import tokens".

### Enter Token Details

**Contract Address**: `0x118917a40FAF1CD7a13dB0Ef56C86De7973Ac503`

MetaMask should auto-fill:
- **Token Symbol**: MUSD
- **Token Decimals**: 18

### Click "Import"

MUSD should now appear in your token list with your balance.

</div>

## How Much Do I Need?

For testing KhipuVault:

| Use Case | MUSD Needed |
|----------|-------------|
| **Try Individual Savings** | 10-100 MUSD |
| **Join Community Pool** | 50-500 MUSD |
| **Participate in ROSCA** | 100+ MUSD |
| **Enter Prize Pool** | 10-100 MUSD |

<Callout type="success">
The faucet usually gives you **1,000 MUSD**, which is plenty to try all products!
</Callout>

## Alternative: Get from a Friend

If the faucet is rate-limited or down:

1. Ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/khipuvault) - community members often share testnet tokens
2. Share your wallet address (safe to share publicly!)
3. Someone can send you MUSD directly

**Your wallet address** is found in MetaMask (click to copy):
```
Example: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb8
```

## Understanding Your Balance

When you open MetaMask on Mezo Testnet, you'll see:

```
🪙 BTC: 0.1 BTC     (for gas fees)
💵 MUSD: 1,000 MUSD (for deposits)
```

- **BTC**: Used to pay transaction fees (gas)
- **MUSD**: The stablecoin you deposit into KhipuVault

<Callout type="info">
Mezo uses **BTC** for gas fees instead of ETH. This is usually very small (less than $0.01 per transaction on testnet).
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### MUSD Not Showing Up

1. **Wait**: Transactions can take 10-30 seconds
2. **Refresh MetaMask**: Close and reopen the extension
3. **Import manually**: Follow the "Add MUSD to MetaMask" section above
4. **Check explorer**: Visit [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org) and search your address

### Faucet Says "Rate Limited"

- You've already requested tokens recently
- Wait 24 hours and try again
- OR ask for tokens in Discord

### Wrong Network

If you see this error:
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown
3. Select "Mezo Testnet"
4. Try the faucet again

### "Insufficient Funds" Error

You need a tiny amount of BTC for gas fees. The faucet should give both MUSD and BTC. If you only have MUSD:
1. Try the faucet again (it might give BTC)
2. Ask in Discord for a small BTC transfer

## Checking Your Transaction

To see your faucet transaction on the blockchain:

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### Copy Transaction Hash

When the faucet succeeds, it shows a transaction hash (looks like `0xabc123...`).

### Visit Block Explorer

Go to [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)

### Paste Transaction Hash

Paste the hash in the search bar.

### View Details

You can see:
- ✅ Transaction status (Success/Pending/Failed)
- 📊 Amount transferred
- ⏰ Timestamp
- 🔗 Block number

</div>
