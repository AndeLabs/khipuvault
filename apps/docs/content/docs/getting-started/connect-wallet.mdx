# Connect Your Wallet

To use KhipuVault, you need a Web3 wallet. We recommend **MetaMask** for beginners.

## What is a Wallet?

A crypto wallet is like a digital bank account that:
- Stores your cryptocurrencies
- Lets you send and receive funds
- Signs transactions securely
- **YOU control** (not a bank or company)

<Callout type="warning">
**Important**: Your wallet's **seed phrase** (12-24 words) is like your master password. NEVER share it with anyone!
</Callout>

## Install MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension wallet that's beginner-friendly and widely supported.

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### Download MetaMask

Go to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io) and click "Download".

Choose your browser:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Brave
- Edge

### Install the Extension

Click "Add to Browser" and follow the prompts.

### Create a New Wallet

1. Click "Create a new wallet"
2. Create a strong password
3. **Write down your seed phrase** (12 words)
4. Store it somewhere safe (NOT on your computer!)

<Callout type="danger" title="Seed Phrase Security">
- ✅ Write it on paper
- ✅ Store in a safe place
- ✅ Make multiple copies
- ❌ NEVER screenshot it
- ❌ NEVER share it with anyone
- ❌ NEVER store it digitally

If you lose your seed phrase, you lose access to your funds forever. If someone else gets it, they can steal your funds.
</Callout>

### Confirm Your Seed Phrase

MetaMask will ask you to confirm your seed phrase by selecting words in the correct order.

## Connect to KhipuVault

Now that you have MetaMask installed, let's connect to KhipuVault:

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### Visit KhipuVault

Go to [https://khipuvault.com](https://khipuvault.com)

### Click "Connect Wallet"

Look for the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner.

### Select MetaMask

A popup will appear asking which wallet to use. Select **MetaMask**.

### Approve the Connection

MetaMask will open and ask for permission. Click **"Connect"**.

<Callout type="info">
This permission only allows KhipuVault to see your wallet address - it cannot access your funds without your explicit approval.
</Callout>

### You're Connected!

Your wallet address should now appear in the top right corner (shortened, like `0x1234...5678`).

</div>

## Understanding Your Wallet Address

Your wallet address looks like: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb8`

Think of it like:
- **Bank account number** - Public, safe to share for receiving funds
- **NOT your password** - Anyone can send you crypto using this address

<Callout type="success">
You can safely share your wallet address to receive funds, just like sharing your email address.
</Callout>

## Wallet Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep your seed phrase offline (paper backup)
- Use a strong password for MetaMask
- Lock your wallet when not in use
- Verify website URLs before connecting
- Use a hardware wallet for large amounts (Ledger, Trezor)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share your seed phrase with ANYONE
- Store your seed phrase digitally
- Use the same password across multiple sites
- Connect to unknown/suspicious websites
- Keep large amounts in a browser extension long-term

## Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Not Appearing?

1. Make sure the extension is installed
2. Click the puzzle icon in your browser toolbar
3. Pin MetaMask to your toolbar
4. Refresh the KhipuVault page

### "Connect Wallet" Button Not Working?

1. Unlock MetaMask (click the extension icon)
2. Make sure you're on the correct network (we'll add Mezo next)
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try a different browser

### I Lost My Seed Phrase

Unfortunately, if you lose your seed phrase and lose access to your wallet, your funds are **permanently lost**. There is no "forgot password" or customer support that can recover it.

This is why backing it up securely is critical!

## Next Steps

Great! You now have a wallet connected to KhipuVault. Next, you need to:

1. ➡️ [Add Mezo Network](/docs/getting-started/add-mezo-network) - Configure Mezo testnet
2. [Get MUSD](/docs/getting-started/get-musd) - Get test tokens
3. [Make Your First Deposit](/docs/getting-started/your-first-deposit) - Start earning!
