# What is KhipuVault?

KhipuVault is a **decentralized savings platform** that brings Bitcoin to everyone through innovative, community-driven products inspired by Andean savings traditions.

## The Vision

Traditional banking excludes billions of people worldwide. KhipuVault democratizes access to Bitcoin-based savings by combining:

- 🏔️ **Andean wisdom** - Centuries-old community savings traditions (ROSCAs/Pasanakus)
- ⛓️ **Blockchain technology** - Transparent, trustless, and secure
- ₿ **Bitcoin foundation** - Built on the most secure cryptocurrency

## How It Works

KhipuVault operates on the **Mezo blockchain**, a Bitcoin Layer-2 that enables smart contracts while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees.

### The Platform

```
User's Bitcoin → Mezo Blockchain → Smart Contracts → Yield Generation
                                                    ↓
                                            Returns to User
```

1. **You deposit** Bitcoin-pegged stablecoins (MUSD) into smart contracts
2. **Smart contracts** manage your funds transparently and securely
3. **Yield protocols** generate returns through DeFi strategies
4. **You earn** yields automatically, visible in real-time

<Callout type="info">
**Your funds, your control**: Unlike traditional banks, KhipuVault smart contracts are non-custodial. You can withdraw anytime (except during ROSCA commitments).
</Callout>

### 3. 🔄 Rotating Pool (ROSCA/Pasanaku)

**Traditional rotating savings digitized.**

Traditional communities use "tandas" (Mexico), "pasanakus" (Bolivia), or "ROSCAs" (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations). KhipuVault brings this proven model to blockchain.

**How it works:**
- Group of people commit to monthly deposits
- Each month, one member receives the full pot
- Rotation continues until everyone has received
- No interest, no banks - just community trust

**Use case**: *"10 friends each deposit $100/month. Each month, one receives $1,000."*

Inspired by PoolTogether, KhipuVault's prize pool lets you:
- Deposit Bitcoin and earn yields
- Yields go into a prize pool
