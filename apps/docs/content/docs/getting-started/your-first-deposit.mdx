MetaMask will ask you to approve two transactions:

**Transaction 1: Approve MUSD**
- This allows the smart contract to access your MUSD
- This is a standard security measure
- Click "Confirm" in MetaMask

<Callout type="info">
You only need to approve once. Future deposits to this pool won't require approval again.
</Callout>

**Transaction 2: Create Pool**
- This creates your personal savings pool
- Gas fee: ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01)
- Click "Confirm" in MetaMask

### Wait for Confirmation

- Transactions usually complete in 5-10 seconds
- You'll see a "Transaction Pending" notification
- Then "Pool Created Successfully!"

### Make Your First Deposit

Now that your pool exists:

1. Enter deposit amount: **100 MUSD** (for testing)
2. Click "Deposit"
3. Confirm transaction in MetaMask

5. Success! 🎉

</div>

<Callout type="success" title="Congratulations!">

</Callout>

## What Happens After Deposit?

### Immediate Effects

1. **Your MUSD is locked in the smart contract**
   - Visible on-chain (transparent)
   - You still control it (can withdraw anytime)

2. **Yields start accumulating**
   - Updated every block (~5 seconds)
   - Visible in your dashboard

3. **Your balance updates**
   - MetaMask shows reduced MUSD
   - KhipuVault shows your deposit + accumulated yields

### Viewing Your Pool

Go to your dashboard to see:

```
💰 Total Deposited: 100 MUSD
📈 Current Yields: 0.5 MUSD (0.5% APY)
📊 Pool Status: Active
⏰ Time Active: 5 minutes
```

### How Yields Work

Your yields come from:
1. **DeFi strategies** - Smart contracts invest your MUSD in yield protocols
2. **Mezo staking** - Bitcoin staking rewards
3. **Liquidity provision** - Providing liquidity to DEXs

<Callout type="info">
**Current APY**: ~12-18% on Individual Savings (varies by market conditions)

**Platform Fee**: 10% of yields (you keep 90%)
</Callout>

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### Go to Your Pool

Navigate to "My Pools" and select the pool.

### Click "Withdraw"

Enter the amount to withdraw (or click "Max" for everything).

### Confirm Transaction

MetaMask will ask to confirm. Approve it.

### Receive Your Funds

- Principal + accumulated yields returned to your wallet
- Usually completes in ~10 seconds
- Check MetaMask to verify

</div>

<Callout type="warning">
**Early Withdrawal**: For Individual Savings, there's NO penalty for withdrawing early. You get your principal + all accumulated yields!

For **ROSCA pools**, you must wait until your scheduled payout.
</Callout>

## Understanding Gas Fees

Each transaction costs a small gas fee (paid in BTC):

| Action | Gas Fee (Testnet) |
|--------|-------------------|
| Approve MUSD | ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01) |
| Create Pool | ~0.0002 BTC (~$0.02) |
| Deposit | ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01) |
| Withdraw | ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01) |

<Callout type="info">
Gas fees on **testnet** are negligible. On **mainnet**, they'll be higher but still much cheaper than Ethereum (~$0.10-$0.50 per transaction).
</Callout>

## Common Questions

### When do yields start?

**Immediately** after your deposit is confirmed. Yields accumulate every block.

### Can I add more later?

**Yes!** Click "Deposit" again to add more MUSD to your pool.

### What if I need my money urgently?

**Withdraw anytime** for Individual Savings. Your principal + yields are returned to your wallet in ~10 seconds.

### Is there a minimum lock period?

**No** for Individual Savings, Community Pools, and Prize Pools. You have full flexibility.

**Yes** for ROSCA - you commit to the rotation cycle.

### What's the maximum I can deposit?

There's no hard maximum, but large deposits (greater than 100K MUSD) should be discussed with the team for optimal yield strategies.

### Are my funds safe?

Your funds are in **audited smart contracts** that you control. We never have custody. [Learn about security →](/docs/security)

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Failed

**Possible causes:**
1. **Insufficient MUSD**: Check your balance
2. **Insufficient BTC for gas**: Get more from faucet
3. **Network congestion**: Wait a minute and try again
4. **Wrong network**: Switch to Mezo Testnet

### Transaction Pending for Too Long

1. Check [Mezo Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
2. Search your transaction hash
3. If it's pending greater than 5 minutes, it might be stuck
4. Try with higher gas (in MetaMask advanced settings)

### MetaMask Errors

- **"User denied transaction"**: You clicked "Reject". Try again and click "Confirm".
- **"Insufficient funds for gas"**: You need more BTC. Get from faucet.
- **"Nonce too high"**: Reset your MetaMask account (Settings → Advanced → Reset Account)

### Pool Not Showing

1. Refresh the page
2. Check that you're connected to the correct wallet
3. Check the transaction on Mezo Explorer to confirm it succeeded
