## Wallet Connection Issues

### Cannot connect wallet

**Symptoms:**
- "Connect Wallet" button doesn't work
- MetaMask doesn't pop up
- Connection keeps failing

**Solutions:**

<Callout type="info" title="Step-by-step fix">
1. **Check MetaMask is installed**
   - Look for fox icon in browser toolbar
   - If missing, install from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)

2. **Unlock MetaMask**
   - Click the MetaMask icon
   - Enter your password
   - Make sure it's not locked

3. **Disable conflicting extensions**
   - Other wallet extensions (Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet) can conflict
   - Disable all except MetaMask
   - Refresh page

4. **Try incognito/private mode**
   - Opens Chrome in incognito: Cmd+Shift+N (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows)
   - Only MetaMask extension should be enabled
   - Try connecting again

5. **Update MetaMask**
   - Click MetaMask icon
   - Settings → About
   - Check for updates
   - Restart browser after updating
</Callout>

### Wallet connects but shows wrong network

**Symptoms:**
- Connected but see "Wrong Network" warning
- Transactions fail with network errors

**Solution:**

Switch to Mezo Testnet:

1. Click network dropdown in MetaMask (top of extension)
2. Select "Mezo Testnet"
3. If not listed, [add it manually](/docs/getting-started/add-mezo-network)

### "Unsupported Chain" error

**Cause:** Your wallet is on the wrong network.

**Solution:**

Add Mezo Testnet to MetaMask:

```
Network Name: Mezo Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.test.mezo.org
Chain ID: 31611
Currency Symbol: BTC
Block Explorer: https://explorer.test.mezo.org
```

## Transaction Failures

### "Transaction Failed" in MetaMask

**Common Causes:**

#### 1. Insufficient Gas

**Error Message:** "Out of Gas" or "Gas estimation failed"

**Solution:**
```
1. Click "Edit" on gas settings
2. Increase "Gas Limit" by 20-30%
3. Keep "Gas Price" at recommended
4. Try again
```

#### 2. Insufficient MUSD Balance

**Error Message:** "Insufficient funds" or "Transfer amount exceeds balance"

**Solution:**
- Check your MUSD balance in MetaMask
- Reduce deposit amount
- Get more MUSD from [faucet](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)

#### 3. MUSD Not Approved

**Error Message:** "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance"

**Solution:**
1. Click "Approve MUSD" before depositing
2. Confirm approval transaction
3. Wait for confirmation (~10 seconds)
4. Then click "Deposit"

#### 4. Slippage Too Low

**Error Message:** "Price impact too high" or "Slippage tolerance exceeded"

**Solution:**
This shouldn't happen with KhipuVault (we don't use AMMs), but if it does:
1. Refresh the page
2. Try again
3. Contact support if persists

#### 5. Contract Paused

**Error Message:** "Pausable: paused"

**Solution:**
- Contracts may be paused during maintenance
- Check [status page](https://status.khipuvault.com)
- Wait for announcement in Discord
- Withdrawals usually still work even when paused

### Transaction stuck on "Pending"

**Symptoms:**
- Transaction shows "Pending" for > 5 minutes
- Nothing happening in blockchain explorer

**Solutions:**

<Callout type="warning" title="Option 1: Speed Up (Recommended)">
1. Click the pending transaction in MetaMask
2. Click "Speed Up"
3. Increase gas price by 10-20%
4. Confirm
5. New transaction will replace old one
</Callout>

**Option 2: Cancel**
1. Click the pending transaction
2. Click "Cancel"
3. Confirm cancellation (costs small gas fee)
4. Start over

**Option 3: Wait**
- Mezo testnet is usually fast (< 30 seconds)
- If > 10 minutes, likely an issue
- Try speed up or cancel

### "Nonce Too Low" error

**Cause:** Transaction nonce conflicts with previous transaction.

**Solution:**

Reset MetaMask account:
1. MetaMask → Settings → Advanced
2. Scroll to "Reset Account"
3. Click and confirm
4. This clears transaction history (safe, doesn't lose funds)
5. Try transaction again

<Callout type="info">
Resetting your account only clears local transaction data. Your funds remain safe on the blockchain.
</Callout>

### "Internal JSON-RPC error"

**Cause:** Usually a temporary RPC node issue.

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait 30 seconds and retry**
2. **Refresh page**
3. **Check RPC endpoint:**
   - MetaMask → Settings → Networks → Mezo Testnet
   - RPC URL should be: `https://rpc.test.mezo.org`
   - If different, update it

---

## Balance and Display Issues

### Balance shows zero but I deposited

**Troubleshooting:**

1. **Check transaction status**
   - Click transaction in MetaMask
   - Click "View on block explorer"
   - Verify it's confirmed (green checkmark)

2. **Verify correct network**
   - Make sure you're on Mezo Testnet
   - Check MetaMask shows "Mezo Testnet" at top

3. **Refresh the page**
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - This forces reload from server

4. **Clear browser cache**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

5. **Check on block explorer**
   - Go to [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
   - Paste your wallet address
   - Verify your deposits are there
   - If yes, it's a UI issue (will resolve)
   - If no, transaction may have failed

### MUSD not showing in MetaMask

**Solution:** Add MUSD token manually

1. Open MetaMask
2. Make sure you're on Mezo Testnet
3. Scroll down to "Tokens"
4. Click "Import tokens"
5. Paste contract address: `0x118917a40FAF1CD7a13dB0Ef56C86De7973Ac503`
6. Symbol: `MUSD`
7. Decimals: `18`
8. Click "Add Custom Token"

### Earnings not updating

**Expected Behavior:**
- Yields distributed weekly (Fridays ~12:00 UTC)
- May take up to 24 hours to reflect in UI

**If beyond 24 hours:**

1. Check last distribution date on pool page
2. Verify pool has yields to distribute
3. Check [Discord #announcements](https://discord.gg/khipuvault) for issues
4. Contact support if > 7 days delayed

## Performance Issues

### Website loading slowly

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Refresh the page**
   - Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows)

2. **Check internet speed**
   - Visit [fast.com](https://fast.com)
   - Need at least 5 Mbps for smooth experience

3. **Try different browser**
   - Chrome (recommended)
   - Firefox
   - Brave

4. **Disable heavy extensions**
   - Ad blockers can slow things down
   - Try disabling temporarily

5. **Check system resources**
   - Close unused tabs
   - Restart browser if using > 50 tabs

### Transactions taking forever to confirm

**Normal Times:**
- Mezo testnet: 5-30 seconds
- During high usage: 1-2 minutes

**If > 5 minutes:**

1. **Check network status**
   - [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
   - Look for recent blocks
   - If no new blocks, network issue

2. **Increase gas price**
   - Click "Speed Up" in MetaMask
   - Increase by 20%

3. **Wait for network to recover**
   - Testnet sometimes has outages
   - Check Discord for updates

## Smart Contract Interaction Issues

### "Execution Reverted" error

**Meaning:** Smart contract rejected your transaction.

**Common Causes:**

1. **Trying to withdraw more than deposited**
   - Check your actual balance
   - Try withdrawing less

2. **Pool restrictions**
   - Some pools have minimum balances
   - Can't withdraw if it leaves you below minimum

3. **ROSCA cycle not complete**
   - Rotating pools lock funds until your turn
   - Check rotation schedule

4. **Contract paused**
   - Emergency pause activated
   - Check status page

**Generic Solution:**
1. Read error message carefully
2. Verify transaction parameters
3. Check pool rules/restrictions
4. Ask in Discord with error details

### "Gas Estimation Failed"

**Cause:** Transaction will likely fail, MetaMask can't estimate gas.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check transaction will succeed**
   - Sufficient balance?
   - Correct parameters?
   - Following pool rules?

2. **Manually set gas limit**
   - Click "Advanced" in MetaMask
   - Set gas limit to 300,000 (usually enough)
   - Proceed carefully (might still fail)

3. **Contact support**
   - If you believe transaction should work
   - Provide transaction details
   - We'll investigate

## Network and RPC Issues

### "RPC Error" or "Network Error"

**Quick Fix:**

1. **Refresh page**
2. **Check network connection**
3. **Verify RPC endpoint:**
   - MetaMask → Networks → Mezo Testnet
   - RPC URL: `https://rpc.test.mezo.org`

**If persists:**

Try alternative RPC (if available):
- Check [Mezo docs](https://docs.mezo.org) for backup RPCs
- Add as custom network
- Switch and try again

### Cannot connect to Mezo network

**Symptoms:**
- "Network unavailable"
- "RPC endpoint not responding"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Mezo network status**
   - [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
   - Should show recent blocks

2. **Verify RPC configuration**
   ```
   RPC URL: https://rpc.test.mezo.org
   Chain ID: 31611
   ```

3. **Try from different location**
   - Use mobile data instead of WiFi
   - Try VPN if behind firewall
   - Some networks block crypto RPCs

4. **Check for Mezo maintenance**

## Data and Sync Issues

### Pool data not syncing

**Symptoms:**
- Old balance showing
- Stale yield data
- Member list outdated

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh page**

- Transaction history is stored locally (browser)
- Clearing cache removes it
- But your funds are safe on blockchain

**Solutions:**

1. **Check block explorer**
   - [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
   - Enter your wallet address
   - View all historical transactions

2. **Export from MetaMask**
   - MetaMask → Settings → Advanced
   - "Export State Logs"
   - Contains transaction history

---

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Clear all data and start fresh

**Nuclear option** (only if nothing else works):

1. **Withdraw all funds first** (important!)
2. **Disconnect wallet from site:**
   - MetaMask → Connected sites
   - Remove khipuvault.com
3. **Clear browser data:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Select all time, all data types
   - Clear
4. **Restart browser completely**
5. **Reconnect wallet**

<Callout type="warning">
This doesn't affect your blockchain funds, only local browser data.
</Callout>

### MetaMask completely broken

**Full reset:**

1. **Export private key first!**
   - MetaMask → Account details → Export private key
   - Save securely

2. **Uninstall MetaMask extension**
