## Getting Started

### What is KhipuVault?

KhipuVault is a **decentralized Bitcoin savings platform** built on the Mezo blockchain. It offers four innovative products:

1. **Individual Savings** - Personal savings with yields
2. **Community Pools** - Group savings with higher yields
3. **Rotating Pool (ROSCA)** - Traditional rotating savings digitized
4. **Prize Pool** - No-loss lottery with Bitcoin

All funds remain in your control (non-custodial) and can be withdrawn anytime.

### Do I need crypto experience to use KhipuVault?

No! Our platform is designed for beginners. You'll need to:

- Install MetaMask wallet (5 minutes)
- Add Mezo network (1 click)
- Get test MUSD from faucet (free)
- Make your first deposit (2 clicks)

Follow our [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started) for step-by-step instructions.

### Is KhipuVault free to use?

Yes, the platform is free. You only pay:

- **Gas fees** for blockchain transactions (usually < $0.50)
- **10% performance fee** on yields earned (not on deposits)

No monthly fees, no hidden charges, no deposit/withdrawal fees.

### What do I need to get started?

You need:

1. ✅ **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave)
2. ✅ **MetaMask wallet** ([download here](https://metamask.io))
3. ✅ **Mezo testnet** added to wallet
4. ✅ **Test MUSD** from [faucet](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)

That's it! No ID, no email, no personal information required.

### How long does it take to set up?

About **5-10 minutes** total:

- Install MetaMask: 3 minutes
- Add Mezo network: 30 seconds
- Get test MUSD: 2 minutes
- First deposit: 1 minute

[Quick start guide](/docs/getting-started#quick-start-5-minutes)

### Is this on Bitcoin mainnet?

Not yet. KhipuVault currently runs on **Mezo testnet** (test network).

- Use test MUSD (no real value)
- Perfect for learning and testing
- Mainnet launch planned for Q2 2026

⚠️ **Don't send real Bitcoin to testnet addresses**

## Products & Features

### What's the difference between the four products?

| Product | Best For | Withdrawals | Yields | Group Size |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Individual Savings** | Personal savings | Anytime | Standard | Just you |
| **Community Pool** | Group savings | Anytime | Higher | 2-100 people |
| **Rotating Pool** | Community ROSCAs | After cycle | None* | 3-50 people |
| **Prize Pool** | Fun + savings | Anytime | Via prizes | Unlimited |

*Rotating pools earn yields collectively, distributed as lump sums

### Can I use multiple products at once?

Yes! You can:

- Save in Individual Savings
- Join a Community Pool with friends
- Participate in a ROSCA with family
- Enter the Prize Pool for fun

Each product is independent. Mix and match as you like.

### What is a Community Pool?

A **Community Pool** is shared savings where members pool funds together to earn higher yields through collective deposits.

**How it works:**
1. Create a pool or join existing one
2. Members deposit Bitcoin (MUSD)
3. Pool earns yields together
4. Each member keeps their share
5. Withdraw anytime (your portion only)

**Benefits:**
- Higher yields than individual savings
- Save with friends/family/community
- Transparent on blockchain
- Still maintain custody

[Learn more](/docs/products/community-pool)

### What is a Rotating Pool (ROSCA)?

A **Rotating Pool** is a digital version of traditional "tandas", "pasanakus", or ROSCAs (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations).

**How it works:**
1. 5-10 people commit to equal monthly deposits
2. Each cycle, one member receives the full pot
3. Rotates until everyone receives their turn
4. Enforced by smart contracts

**Example:**
- 10 members × $100/month = $1,000 pot
- Month 1: Alice receives $1,000
- Month 2: Bob receives $1,000
- ... continues for 10 months

[Learn more](/docs/products/rotating-pool)

### What is the Prize Pool?

A **Prize Pool** is a no-loss lottery. Deposit Bitcoin, earn yields, and win prizes - without risking your principal.

**How it works:**
1. Deposit MUSD into prize pool
2. Pool generates yields collectively
3. Weekly/monthly prize drawings
4. Winners receive accumulated yields
5. Withdraw principal anytime

**Benefits:**
- Can't lose your deposit
- Chance to win big prizes
- Fun way to save
- Withdraw anytime

[Learn more](/docs/products/prize-pool)

### Can I create my own Community Pool?

**Private Pools:**
1. Get invite link from pool creator
2. Click the link
3. Request to join
4. Wait for approval
5. Make your deposit

## Yields & Earnings

### How do yields work?

Yields come from **deploying pooled Bitcoin** into various DeFi strategies:

- Mezo staking rewards
- Bitcoin lending protocols
- Liquidity provision
- MEZ token incentives (future)

Your deposit earns yields automatically. Earnings are distributed weekly.

### What are the typical yields?

**Current yields (testnet):**
- Individual Savings: ~5-8% APY
- Community Pools: ~8-12% APY
- Rotating Pools: Varies (lump sum)
- Prize Pools: Prizes from collective yields

⚠️ **Yields are variable** and depend on market conditions.

### How are yields calculated?

**Formula:**
```
Your Yield = (Your Deposit / Total Pool) × Pool Earnings
```

**Example:**
- You deposit: 1,000 MUSD
- Total pool: 100,000 MUSD (you're 1%)
- Pool earns: 500 MUSD this week
- Your share: 500 × 1% = 5 MUSD

### When are yields distributed?

**Distribution Schedule:**

| Product | Frequency | Method |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Individual Savings | Weekly | Auto-compound |
| Community Pool | Weekly | Auto-compound |
| Rotating Pool | End of cycle | Lump sum |
| Prize Pool | Weekly drawing | Prize to winners |

### Can I compound my yields?

**Yes, automatically!**

Yields are added to your principal and earn yields too.

**Example:**
- Week 1: Deposit 1,000 MUSD, earn 10 MUSD
- Week 2: Now earning on 1,010 MUSD
- Week 3: Now earning on 1,020.10 MUSD
- Compounding effect grows over time

### Are yields guaranteed?

**No.** Yields are **variable** and depend on:

- DeFi protocol performance
- Market conditions
- Total pool deposits
- Network activity

<Callout type="warning">
Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Yields can go up or down.
</Callout>

### What's the difference between APY and APR?

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**
- Simple interest (no compounding)
- Example: 10% APR = 10% per year

**APY (Annual Percentage Yield)**
- Compound interest (reinvesting earnings)
- Example: 10% APY = ~10.52% effective rate

KhipuVault displays APY because we auto-compound yields.

### Can yields be negative?

In theory yes, but unlikely:

- Smart contracts could lose funds (rare)
- DeFi protocols could fail
- We use conservative strategies to minimize risk

If yields are negative, we **pause operations** until resolved.

## Fees & Costs

### What fees does KhipuVault charge?

**Platform Fees:**
- Deposits: **Free**
- Withdrawals: **Free**
- Yield earnings: **10% performance fee**

**Blockchain Fees:**
- Gas for transactions: **~$0.10-$1.00** (paid to network)

### What is the 10% performance fee?

We take **10% of your yield earnings** (not your principal).

**Example:**
- You earn 100 MUSD in yields
- Fee: 10 MUSD (10%)
- You keep: 90 MUSD
- Your principal: **Never touched**

This fee funds:
- Development and maintenance
- Security audits
- Customer support
- Platform improvements

### Are there any hidden fees?

**No hidden fees.** You only pay:

1. **Gas fees** (blockchain network, not us)
2. **10% performance fee** (only on yields earned)

That's it. No:
- ❌ Deposit fees
- ❌ Withdrawal fees
- ❌ Monthly/annual fees
- ❌ Inactivity fees
- ❌ Early withdrawal penalties (except ROSCA)

### How much are gas fees?

**Typical Costs (Mezo Testnet):**

| Action | Gas Cost |
|--------|----------|
| Deposit | ~$0.10 |
| Withdraw | ~$0.15 |
| Claim yields | ~$0.08 |
| Join pool | ~$0.12 |

Actual costs vary based on network congestion.

**Mainnet will be higher** - plan for $1-5 per transaction.

### Can I avoid gas fees?

No, gas fees are paid to the blockchain network (not KhipuVault). They're necessary to process transactions.

**Ways to minimize:**
- Batch transactions (deposit once, not many times)
- Time transactions (off-peak hours cheaper)
- Wait for low gas prices

### Are there fees to join a Community Pool?

No fees to join. You pay:
- Gas fee to join pool (~$0.12)
- Gas fee for first deposit (~$0.10)
- 10% performance fee on earnings (later)

### Do Rotating Pools have early withdrawal fees?

**Yes.** Rotating Pools require commitment:

- **Early withdrawal penalty**: Lose your turn in rotation
- **Blacklist risk**: May be excluded from future pools
- **Social pressure**: Letting down your community

Only join if you can commit to the full cycle.
