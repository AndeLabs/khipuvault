## Understanding Multi-Pool Strategy

### Why Diversify Across Pools?

Each pool type serves different purposes:

| Pool Type          | Primary Benefit        | Liquidity | Risk  | Yield  |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Individual Savings | Flexibility & Control  | High      | Low   | Medium |
| Cooperative Pool   | Community & Higher APY | Medium    | Low   | High   |
| ROSCA              | Discipline & Lump Sum  | Low       | Low   | High   |
| Prize Pool         | Excitement & Jackpots  | High      | Low   | Variable|

<Callout type="info">
  **Diversification Benefits**: Reduce concentration risk, access different yield strategies, maintain liquidity while pursuing higher returns, and enjoy variety.

| **TOTAL**             | **1.5** | **9.6% avg**| **0.0120 BTC**| **0.144 BTC**     |

## Step 2: Define Your Allocation Strategy

### Identify Your Goals

What are you optimizing for?

#### Goal 1: Maximum Yield
**Allocation**:
- 20% Individual (unlocked) - emergency fund
- 30% Individual (locked) - highest locked rate
- 40% Community pools - community bonus
- 10% ROSCA - disciplined savings

**Expected APY**: ~10.5%

#### Goal 2: Maximum Flexibility
**Allocation**:
- 70% Individual (unlocked) - instant access
- 20% Community pools - short notice
- 10% Prize pools - fun + flexible

**Expected APY**: ~8.8%

#### Goal 3: Balanced Approach (Recommended)
**Allocation**:
- 40% Individual (mix of locked/unlocked)
- 30% Community pools
- 20% ROSCA
- 10% Prize pools

**Expected APY**: ~9.6%

#### Goal 4: Community Builder
**Allocation**:
- 20% Individual (unlocked)
- 50% Community pools (multiple)
- 20% ROSCA
- 10% Prize pools

**Expected APY**: ~10.2% + social benefits

### Set Target Allocation

Choose your strategy and set targets:

```
TARGET ALLOCATION (Balanced Strategy)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Total Portfolio:     1.5 BTC

Individual:          0.6 BTC (40%)
- Unlocked:         0.4 BTC (26.7%)
- Locked:           0.2 BTC (13.3%)

Community:           0.45 BTC (30%)
- Cooperative:      0.3 BTC (20%)
- Specialized:      0.15 BTC (10%)

ROSCA:               0.3 BTC (20%)
- Monthly:          0.2 BTC (13.3%)
- Weekly:           0.1 BTC (6.7%)

Prize Pools:         0.15 BTC (10%)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Step 3: Rebalance Your Portfolio

### Calculate Required Changes

Compare current vs target:

| Category    | Current | Target  | Difference | Action   |
|-------------|---------|---------|------------|----------|
| Individual  | 0.8 BTC | 0.6 BTC | -0.2 BTC   | Reduce   |
| Community   | 0.5 BTC | 0.45 BTC| -0.05 BTC  | Reduce   |
| ROSCA       | 0.15 BTC| 0.3 BTC | +0.15 BTC  | Increase |
| Prize Pool  | 0.05 BTC| 0.15 BTC| +0.1 BTC   | Increase |

### Execute Rebalancing

#### Step 3a: Withdraw from Over-Allocated Pools

**From Individual Savings**:
1. Navigate to Individual Savings
2. Click "Withdraw"
3. Enter amount: 0.2 BTC
4. Choose source: Unlocked balance (instant)
5. Confirm withdrawal to wallet
6. Wait for confirmation

**From Community Pool**:
1. Navigate to Tech Workers Pool
2. Request withdrawal: 0.05 BTC
3. Wait for notice period (e.g., 48 hours)
4. Claim withdrawal when ready

#### Step 3b: Deposit to Under-Allocated Pools

**Increase ROSCA Allocation**:
1. Find suitable ROSCA (monthly frequency)
2. Join with 0.15 BTC deposit
3. Or increase existing ROSCA position if allowed

**Increase Prize Pool Allocation**:
1. Navigate to Weekly Jackpot
2. Deposit additional 0.1 BTC
3. Receive 10 more tickets

<Callout type="info">
  **Rebalancing Frequency**: Quarterly rebalancing is sufficient. Over-rebalancing wastes gas fees and reduces compounding.
</Callout>

### Rebalancing Calendar

Set reminders:

- **Monthly Review**: Check performance, no action
- **Quarterly Rebalance**: Adjust if greater than 5% drift from target
- **Annual Strategy Review**: Revisit goals and targets

## Step 4: Use the Portfolio Dashboard

Net Cash Flow:               -0.15 BTC
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Cash Flow Planning**: Ensure wallet has sufficient BTC to meet all upcoming ROSCA commitments. Missing payments damages reputation.
</Callout>

### Set Up Auto-Funding

Configure automatic wallet funding:

1. Settings → Auto-Funding
2. Set threshold: "Alert when wallet less than 0.1 BTC"
3. Configure auto-withdrawal from unlocked pools
4. Set maximum auto-withdrawal limit

**Example Configuration**:
```
IF wallet balance less than 0.1 BTC
THEN withdraw 0.05 BTC from Individual Savings (unlocked)
TO wallet
Max once per week
```

### Emergency Liquidity Plan

Define priority withdrawal order:

**Tier 1 - Immediate** (0-24 hours):
1. Individual savings (unlocked)
2. Prize pool withdrawals

**Tier 2 - Short Notice** (2-7 days):
3. Community pool withdrawals (with notice)

**Tier 3 - If Absolutely Necessary** (7+ days):
4. Early unlock from locked individual savings (penalty)
5. Exit ROSCA (forfeit yield, reputation damage)

## Step 6: Monitor and Optimize

### Weekly Review Checklist

Every week:

- [ ] Check total portfolio value
- [ ] Review yield generation (on track?)
- [ ] Verify upcoming ROSCA deposits funded
- [ ] Check prize pool drawing results
- [ ] Review any community pool governance items
- [ ] Respond to any pending requests

**Time Required**: 5-10 minutes

### Monthly Deep Dive

Every month:

- [ ] Calculate actual vs expected yields
- [ ] Review allocation drift (greater than 5% from target?)
- [ ] Evaluate pool performance (any underperformers?)
- [ ] Check ROSCA schedules and payout dates
- [ ] Update financial goals if needed
- [ ] Consider new pool opportunities
- [ ] Download transaction history for records

**Time Required**: 20-30 minutes

### Performance Tracking Spreadsheet

Maintain monthly records:

```
Month    | Total | Ind  | Comm | ROSCA| Prize| Yield | APY  | Notes
---------|-------|------|------|------|------|-------|------|-------
Jan 2025 | 1.50  | 0.80 | 0.50 | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.012 | 9.6% | Initial
Feb 2025 | 1.53  | 0.81 | 0.52 | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.012 | 9.7% | Slight growth
Mar 2025 | 1.56  | 0.60 | 0.45 | 0.36 | 0.15 | 0.013 | 10.0%| Rebalanced
Apr 2025 | 2.14  | 0.62 | 0.47 | 0.90 | 0.15 | 0.013 | 10.1%| ROSCA payout
```

## Step 7: Advanced Multi-Pool Strategies

### Ladder Strategy

Create maturity ladders for steady access:

**Individual Savings Ladder**:
```
0.1 BTC unlocked    - Immediate access
0.1 BTC 30-day      - Unlocks next month
0.1 BTC 90-day      - Unlocks in 3 months
0.1 BTC 180-day     - Unlocks in 6 months
0.1 BTC 365-day     - Unlocks in 12 months
```

**Benefits**:
- Regular liquidity events
- Maximize locked-rate bonuses
- Smooth cash flow
- Reduce timing risk

### ROSCA Rotation Strategy

Join multiple ROSCAs with staggered positions:

```
ROSCA A (Monthly, 12 members):  Your position #3  → Payout Month 3
ROSCA B (Monthly, 12 members):  Your position #6  → Payout Month 6
ROSCA C (Monthly, 12 members):  Your position #9  → Payout Month 9
ROSCA D (Monthly, 12 members):  Your position #12 → Payout Month 12
```

**Result**: Receive major payout every 3 months!

### Yield Harvesting Strategy

Optimize for short-term yield:

1. **Monitor APY changes** across pools
2. **Move funds** to highest-yielding pools weekly
3. **Accept gas costs** in exchange for yield optimization
4. **Best for**: Large portfolios where gas is less than 0.1% of deposit

**Example**:
- Week 1: Pool A offers 12% APY → Move 0.5 BTC there
- Week 2: Pool B offers 13% APY → Move to Pool B
- Net gain from optimization: ~0.5-1% extra APY

<Callout type="warning">
  **Gas Consideration**: Yield harvesting only makes sense for larger positions. Calculate if extra yield > gas costs.
</Callout>

### Community Pool Portfolio

Become a community pool specialist:

- Join 5-10 different community pools
- Diversify across communities, sizes, purposes
- Learn pool management from different creators
- Build reputation across multiple communities
- Earn community-specific bonuses

## Automation Features

### Auto-Rebalance

Set up automatic rebalancing:

1. Settings → Portfolio Management
2. Enable "Auto-Rebalance"
3. Set rebalance threshold: "When allocation drifts greater than 10%"
4. Set rebalance frequency: "Monthly"
5. Choose rebalance source: Individual savings (unlocked)
6. Set max transaction size: 0.2 BTC per rebalance

### Yield Auto-Compound

Configure yield compounding:

- **Individual Savings**: Auto-compounds by default
- **Community Pools**: Choose "Reinvest" vs "Distribute"
- **Prize Pools**: Auto-reinvest small wins (less than 0.01 BTC)
- **ROSCAs**: Not applicable (yield distributed at payout)

### Smart Notifications

Configure intelligent alerts:

**Performance Alerts**:
- Portfolio underperforming target by greater than 2% for 30 days
- Specific pool underperforming by greater than 3%

**Risk Alerts**:
- Allocation drift greater than 15% from target
- Liquidity below 25%
- Single pool greater than 50% of portfolio

**Opportunity Alerts**:
- New pool with greater than 12% APY available
- Pool you're in has opening for more deposits
- Lock period expiring soon (reinvest opportunity)

## Common Questions

### How many pools is too many?

**Sweet Spot**: 4-6 active pools

**Reasoning**:
- Enough diversification
- Manageable complexity
- Still competitive yields
- Reasonable time commitment

**Maximum**: 10 pools (gets hard to track)

### Should I exit underperforming pools?

**Consider exit if**:
- Pool underperforms by greater than 2% for 90 days
- Better opportunities available
- Pool health deteriorating
- Liquidity needs changed

**Don't exit just because**:
- Short-term underperformance (less than 30 days)
- Minor differences (less than 0.5% APY)
- Market-wide yield drop

### How much in each pool type?

**Conservative**:
- 70% Individual
- 20% Community
- 10% ROSCA/Prize

**Balanced**:
- 40% Individual
- 30% Community
- 20% ROSCA
- 10% Prize

**Aggressive**:
- 20% Individual
- 40% Community
- 30% ROSCA
- 10% Prize

## Troubleshooting

### Can't track all commitments

**Solution**:
- Use portfolio calendar feature
- Export to Google Calendar
- Set up SMS reminders
- Consider reducing pool count

### Frequent rebalancing losing to gas fees

**Solution**:
- Increase rebalance threshold (20%+ drift)
- Rebalance less frequently (quarterly vs monthly)
- Only rebalance large amounts
- Batch multiple rebalances together

### Liquidity crunch

**Prevention**:
- Maintain 30%+ in liquid pools
- Don't over-commit to ROSCAs
- Ladder lock periods
- Keep emergency fund outside KhipuVault
