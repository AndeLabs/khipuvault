## Understanding ROSCAs

### What is a ROSCA?

A ROSCA is a traditional savings model adapted for blockchain:

**Traditional ROSCA**: Group of people contribute fixed amounts regularly. Each period, one member receives the total pot. Continues until everyone has received a payout.

**KhipuVault ROSCA**: Same concept, but:
- Transparent on blockchain
- Smart contract enforced
- Earns yield while waiting
- No central administrator needed

### How ROSCAs Work

    A[10 Members Join] --> B[Each Deposits 0.1 BTC]
    B --> C[Total Pool: 1 BTC]
    C --> D[Month 1: Member #1 Receives 1 BTC]
    D --> E[Month 2: Member #2 Receives 1 BTC]
    E --> F[Continue for 10 Months]
    F --> G[Everyone Received Payout]
    G --> H[ROSCA Completes]
```

### Key ROSCA Features

**Fixed Deposits**: Same amount, same schedule (weekly/monthly)

**Rotation Order**: Predetermined or lottery-based

**Accountability**: Smart contract enforces participation

**Yield Bonus**: Funds earn yield while in pool

**No-Loss**: Always get your contributions back + yield

## Common Questions

### What if I can't make a deposit?

1. **Communicate early**: Tell group ASAP
2. **Grace period**: Use 7-day grace period
3. **Borrow**: Consider borrowing from emergency fund
4. **Removal**: Last resort, you get contributions back

### Can I leave a ROSCA early?

**Generally No**, but exceptions:

- Medical emergency
- Job loss
- Other severe hardship

**Process**:
1. Request early exit
2. Member vote required
3. If approved: Receive contributions minus yield
4. Damages reputation

### What if another member doesn't pay?

Smart contract handles it:

1. Member enters grace period
2. If still unpaid after 7 days, member removed
3. Their contributions distributed to active members
4. ROSCA continues with remaining members

### Can I join multiple ROSCAs?

**Yes**, but carefully:

- Ensure you can afford all commitments
- Stagger payout positions across ROSCAs
- Different deposit schedules to spread cash flow
- Track all obligations in calendar

## Troubleshooting

### Deposit Transaction Failed

**Solutions**:
1. Check wallet has sufficient BTC + gas
2. Verify you're on correct network
3. Try increasing gas limit
4. Check ROSCA isn't paused
5. Contact ROSCA admin

### Can't Claim Payout

**Reasons**:
1. Not yet your turn
2. Outstanding deposit obligations
3. Contract issue
4. Already claimed

**Solution**: Check payout schedule and deposit status

### Removed from ROSCA

**What happens**:
- Smart contract returns your contributions
- Forfeit yield earned
- Reputation penalty
- Cannot rejoin this ROSCA

**Next steps**:

- Ensure future commitments are manageable
- Rebuild reputation in smaller ROSCAs
