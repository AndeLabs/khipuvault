## Understanding Prize Pools

### What is a No-Loss Lottery?

A revolutionary savings model that combines:

**Traditional Lottery**: Chance to win big prizes
**Savings Account**: Keep your deposit forever
**Yield Generation**: Your deposit earns interest

**Key Innovation**: Prize pool uses the YIELD to fund prizes, not your principal!

    A[Your Deposit] --> B[Earns Yield]
    B --> C[Yield Goes to Prize Pool]
    C --> D[Winners Selected]
    D --> E[You Keep Principal]
    E --> F[Enter Next Draw]
```

### How Prize Pools Work

1. **Deposit**: You deposit Bitcoin (e.g., 0.1 BTC)
2. **Earn Tickets**: Each deposit unit = tickets (0.01 BTC = 1 ticket)
3. **Yield Accrues**: Your deposit earns yield (~8-10% APY)
4. **Prize Pool**: All participants' yield combined into prize pool
5. **Drawing**: Random selection of winners
6. **Keep Deposit**: Win or lose, you keep your 0.1 BTC
7. **Repeat**: Automatically entered in next draw

<Callout type="success">
  **No-Loss Guarantee**: You NEVER lose your principal. Worst case: you earn 0% APY. Best case: win massive prizes!
</Callout>

Example listing:

```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Filter and Compare

Use filters to find ideal pools:

**By Drawing Frequency**:
- Daily (365 chances/year)
- Weekly (52 chances/year)
- Monthly (12 chances/year)
- Quarterly (4 chances/year)

**By Prize Size**:
- Small (< 0.5 BTC)
- Medium (0.5 - 2 BTC)
- Large (2 - 10 BTC)
- Mega (10+ BTC)

**By Odds**:
- High probability (daily, smaller pools)
- Medium probability (weekly pools)
- Low probability (monthly, mega jackpots)

**By Participants**:
- Small pools (< 100 players) = better odds
- Medium pools (100-1000 players) = balanced
- Large pools (1000+ players) = bigger prizes

<Callout type="info">
  **Strategy Tip**: Smaller pools have better odds but smaller prizes. Larger pools have worse odds but life-changing prizes. Diversify!
</Callout>

## Step 2: Evaluate Prize Pools

### Key Metrics to Review

#### Expected Value (EV)

Calculate if a pool is worth entering:

```
Your Deposit:        0.1 BTC (10 tickets)
Total Tickets:       10,000 tickets
Prize Pool:          1 BTC
Your Win Chance:     10/10,000 = 0.1%
Expected Win:        1 BTC × 0.1% = 0.001 BTC
Alternative APY:     ~8% = 0.008 BTC/year yield

EV Comparison:       Prize pool slightly lower EV
But: Excitement value + chance at lump sum!
```

#### Pool Health Indicators

Look for:
- **Active Participants**: More players = bigger prizes
- **Consistent Growth**: Pool size increasing = healthy
- **Regular Drawings**: On-time draws = trustworthy
- **Winner Verification**: Provable fairness + on-chain verification
- **Audit Status**: Smart contract audited

#### Prize Distribution

Evaluate prize structure:

**Top-Heavy** (90% to 1st place):
- Massive grand prize
- Few winners overall
- High risk/reward

**Distributed** (many smaller prizes):
- More winners
- Better average return
- Feels more rewarding

**Balanced** (mix):
- Big prize + many consolation prizes
- Best of both worlds

<Callout type="warning">
  **Realistic Expectations**: Prize pools are FUN and EXCITING, but individual savings pools offer better guaranteed returns. Use prize pools for a small portion of your portfolio.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Enter a Prize Pool

### Entry Process

1. Click "Enter Prize Pool" on selected pool
2. Entry modal appears with details

### Choose Entry Amount

Determine your deposit:

```
Ticket Price:        0.01 BTC = 1 ticket
Your Entry:          0.1 BTC = 10 tickets
More Tickets:        Better odds!

Ticket Calculator:
1 ticket    = 0.01%  chance to win (1 in 10,000)
10 tickets  = 0.1%   chance to win (1 in 1,000)
100 tickets = 1%     chance to win (1 in 100)
1000 tickets = 10%   chance to win (1 in 10)
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Ticket Strategy**: More tickets = better odds. But diversifying across multiple pools may offer better overall chances.
</Callout>

### Entry Options

**Single Entry**:
- One-time deposit
- Stays until you withdraw
- Auto-enters each drawing

**Recurring Entry**:
- Automatic weekly/monthly deposits
- Build tickets over time
- Dollar-cost averaging into lottery

**Bulk Entry**:
- Large one-time deposit
- Immediate high ticket count
- Better initial odds

### Tax Implications

Prizes are taxable income in most jurisdictions:

- KhipuVault provides winning statement
- Download for tax records
- Consult tax professional
- See [Tax Reporting Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/advanced/tax-reporting)

## Step 7: Optimize Your Strategy

### Multi-Pool Approach

Diversify across pool types:

```
Portfolio:           0.5 BTC total
Strategy:
├─ Daily (0.15 BTC):     Frequent small wins
├─ Weekly (0.20 BTC):    Balanced approach
└─ Monthly (0.15 BTC):   Big prize hunting

Expected:
- ~4 daily wins/year (small amounts)
- ~2 weekly wins/year (medium amounts)
- ~0.5 monthly wins/year (potential big prize)
```

### Ticket Accumulation Strategy

Build tickets over time:

**Week 1-4**: Deposit 0.025 BTC weekly to Weekly Jackpot
- Week 1: 2.5 tickets
- Week 2: 5 tickets
- Week 3: 7.5 tickets
- Week 4: 10 tickets

**Advantage**: Average cost, build position gradually

### Odds Optimization

Improve winning chances:

1. **Enter Early**: Fewer participants = better odds
2. **New Pools**: Less competition initially
3. **Smaller Pools**: Better odds despite smaller prizes
4. **Bulk Entries**: More tickets = proportionally better chances
5. **Consistent Participation**: More drawings = more chances

### Expected Value Calculations

Track your performance:

```
Tracking Spreadsheet:

Date    | Pool    | Deposit | Tickets | Draw | Won? | Amount | ROI
--------|---------|---------|---------|------|------|--------|----
Mar 1   | Weekly  | 0.1     | 10      | #52  | No   | -      | -
Mar 8   | Weekly  | 0.1     | 10      | #53  | Yes  | 0.0125 | +12.5%
Mar 15  | Weekly  | 0.1     | 10      | #54  | No   | -      | -
Mar 22  | Weekly  | 0.1     | 10      | #55  | No   | -      | -

Total:           0.4 BTC deposited
Prizes:          0.0125 BTC won
Net:             Still have 0.4 BTC deposit + 0.0125 prize
Effective APY:   ~12.5% (better than savings this month!)
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Long-Term Perspective**: Prize pools are volatile. Some months you win, some you don't. Over time, returns average to slightly below individual savings APY, but excitement factor is priceless!

## Common Questions

### What if I need to withdraw before drawing?

**No problem!**
- Withdraw anytime
- Get full principal back
- Forfeit tickets for that drawing
- Can re-enter any time

### Do more tickets always mean better odds?

**Yes, proportionally**:
- 1 ticket = 0.01% chance
- 10 tickets = 0.1% chance (10x better)
- 100 tickets = 1% chance (100x better)

But total pool size matters too!

### Can I buy tickets without depositing?

**No**:
- Tickets = representation of your deposit
- 0.01 BTC deposit = 1 ticket
- Ensures you have skin in the game
- Prevents infinite ticket buying

### What happens to unclaimed prizes?

After 30-day deadline:
- Returns to prize pool
- Increases next drawing's prize
- Benefits all participants

### Are there "better" times to enter?

**Early in drawing period**:
- Fewer participants (better odds)
- More time to accumulate tickets
- Lower prize initially

**Late in drawing period**:
- See current prize size
- More participants (worse odds)
- Prize fully grown

**Verdict**: Enter early, stay consistent

## Troubleshooting

### Entry Transaction Failed

**Solutions**:
1. Check sufficient BTC + gas fees
2. Verify pool is accepting entries
3. Check drawing hasn't closed for this round
4. Try smaller entry amount
5. Contact support if persists

### Tickets Not Showing

**Reasons**:
1. Transaction still confirming (wait 1-2 min)
2. UI not refreshed (hard refresh page)
3. Wrong wallet connected
4. Entry failed (check transaction status)

### Prize Claim Failing

**Common Issues**:
1. Already claimed
2. Claim period expired
3. Not actually a winner (double-check)
4. Smart contract issue

**Solution**: Contact support with transaction hash

### Lower Odds Than Expected

**Reality Check**:
- Your tickets / total tickets = your odds
- Pool growing = your odds decreasing
- Still better than traditional lottery!
- Remember: You can't lose principal
