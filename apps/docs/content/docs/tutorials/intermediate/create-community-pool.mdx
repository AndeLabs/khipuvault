## Understanding Community Pools

### What is a Community Pool?

A community pool is a shared savings vehicle where multiple members pool their Bitcoin together to:

- Earn enhanced yields through collective bargaining power
- Build community trust and social accountability
- Access group benefits and bonuses
- Share resources and financial knowledge

### Pool Types

KhipuVault offers three community pool types:

#### 1. Cooperative Pool

Standard shared savings with flexible terms:

- Members deposit and withdraw freely
- Shared yield distribution
- Democratic governance
- Best for: Friends, families, trusted communities

#### 2. ROSCA (Rotating Savings and Credit Association)

Structured rotation system:

- Fixed deposit schedule (e.g., weekly, monthly)
- Members take turns receiving the pot
- Builds savings discipline
- Best for: Groups wanting forced savings + periodic payouts

#### 3. Prize Pool (Lottery)

Gamified savings with chance element:

- Regular deposits required
- Random winners receive prizes
- No-loss lottery (keep your principal)
- Best for: Engaging new savers, larger communities

<Callout type="info">
  **First Pool Recommendation**: Start with a Cooperative Pool for maximum flexibility while learning pool management.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Plan Your Pool

### Define Your Pool's Purpose

Before creating, clarify:

1. **Goal**: Emergency fund? Down payment savings? General wealth building?
2. **Members**: Who will join? How many? (Minimum 3, maximum varies by type)
3. **Terms**: Flexible or structured deposits?
4. **Duration**: Ongoing or fixed term?

### Calculate Pool Economics

Example planning for a 10-member pool:

```
Target Pool Size:      1 BTC total
Per Member:            0.1 BTC minimum
Expected APY:          10% (higher than individual)
Duration:              12 months
Expected Pool Yield:   0.1 BTC total
Per Member Return:     0.01 BTC (10% return)
```

### Choose Pool Type

| If you want...                          | Choose           |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Maximum flexibility                     | Cooperative Pool |
| Forced savings discipline               | ROSCA           |
| Engagement and excitement               | Prize Pool      |
| Trust-building with new members         | ROSCA           |
| Long-term family wealth building        | Cooperative Pool |

## Step 2: Navigate to Pool Creation

### Access the Interface

1. Visit [app.khipuvault.com](https://app.khipuvault.com)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Navigate to "Community Savings" in the sidebar
4. Click "Create New Pool" button

### Pool Creation Dashboard

You'll see three creation options:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Create Community Pool               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│  [Cooperative Pool]  [ROSCA]  [Prize Pool]  │
│                                             │
│  Click to select pool type                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 3: Configure Pool Parameters (Cooperative Pool Example)

### Basic Information

Fill in the pool details form:

#### Pool Name
```
Example: "Tech Workers Savings Circle"
Guidelines:
- Clear and descriptive
- Identifies the group
- Professional (others will see this)
- Max 50 characters
```

#### Pool Description
```
Example: "Monthly savings pool for tech professionals
in San Francisco. Goal: Build emergency funds and
learn DeFi together."

Guidelines:
- Explain pool purpose
- Target member profile
- Goals and expectations
- 200-500 characters
```

#### Pool Icon (Optional)
- Upload custom icon or choose from templates
- Represents pool in UI
- Recommended: 512x512px PNG

### Membership Settings

Configure who can join and how:

#### Maximum Members
```
Recommended: 10-20 for first pool
Minimum: 3
Maximum: 100
```

<Callout type="warning">
  **Start Small**: Easier to manage smaller pools initially. You can always create larger pools later with experience.
</Callout>

#### Joining Requirements

**Membership Type**:
- **Open**: Anyone can join (subject to minimum deposit)
- **Approval Required**: Admin approves each member
- **Invite-Only**: Only invited addresses can join

**Recommended for first pool**: Invite-Only or Approval Required

#### Minimum Deposit Per Member
```
Example: 0.05 BTC
Considerations:
- Should be affordable for all target members
- High enough to show commitment
- Typically 5-20% of target pool size
```

### Financial Rules

#### Yield Distribution

How are earnings shared?

**Proportional (Recommended)**:
- Each member earns based on their deposit size
- Fair and transparent
- Example: 10% of pool = 10% of yield

**Equal Split**:
- All members earn same yield regardless of deposit
- Encourages smaller savers
- May feel unfair to larger depositors

**Hybrid**:
- Combination of proportional and equal
- Example: 70% proportional + 30% equal split

#### Withdrawal Rules

**Flexible (Recommended for first pool)**:
- Members can withdraw anytime
- May have cooldown period (e.g., 7 days notice)

**Lock Period**:
- Funds locked for specified duration
- Higher yields due to predictability
- Example: 90-day lock periods

**Vote Required**:
- Withdrawals need member approval
- Highest accountability
- Slower process

### Governance Settings

#### Admin Structure

**Single Admin (You)**:
- Fastest decisions
- Simplest management
- Recommended for first pool

**Multi-Sig Admin**:
- Requires multiple admins to approve actions
- Higher security
- Slower but more democratic

**DAO Governance**:
- Members vote on decisions
- Most democratic
- Complex to manage

#### Votable Actions

Choose what requires member votes:

- [ ] Pool parameter changes
- [ ] New member approvals
- [ ] Emergency withdrawals
- [ ] Yield distribution changes
- [ ] Pool closure

<Callout type="info">
  **Balance**: Too many votes slow things down. Too few reduce member input. Start conservative with admin control.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Review and Create

### Configuration Summary

Review all settings before deployment:

```

## Step 8: Monitor Pool Health

### Pool Dashboard Overview

Your pool admin dashboard shows:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
      TECH WORKERS SAVINGS CIRCLE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
Total Pool Value:        1.25 BTC
Members:                 8/15
Total Yield Earned:      0.0523 BTC
Current APY:             10.2%
Pool Health:             Excellent ✓
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Last Activity:           2 hours ago
Next Payout:             N/A (continuous)
Pending Actions:         0
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Key Metrics to Track

#### Member Activity
- Deposit frequency
- Withdrawal patterns
- Engagement level (votes, proposals)

#### Financial Health
- Total pool size (growing or shrinking?)
- Yield generation (meeting expectations?)
- Member contribution diversity (one dominant member?)

#### Engagement Metrics
- Active vs inactive members
- Participation in governance
- Communication channel activity

### Health Indicators

**Green (Healthy)**:
- Steady or growing pool size
- Regular member activity
- High engagement
- Yield meeting projections

**Yellow (Attention Needed)**:
- Stagnant pool size
- Several inactive members
- Below-target yields

**Red (Action Required)**:
- Declining pool size
- Multiple withdrawal requests
- Very low engagement
- Conflict among members

## Step 9: Handle Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Member Wants to Withdraw

**Process**:
1. Member submits withdrawal request
2. You receive notification
3. Review request against pool rules
4. If flexible: Auto-approved after cooldown
5. If restricted: Vote or admin decision required

**Best Practice**:
- Communicate reason for withdrawal
- Offer alternatives (reduce deposit instead of full withdrawal?)
- Ensure smooth process to maintain trust

### Scenario 2: New Member Request Above Limit

**Issue**: Pool at max capacity (15/15) but new applicant wants to join

**Options**:
1. Increase max member limit (requires parameter change)
2. Create waiting list
3. Start second pool for overflow
4. Invite applicant to different pool type

### Scenario 3: Low Engagement

**Signs**: No votes, silent communication channels, decreasing deposits

**Solutions**:
1. Host pool meeting (virtual or in-person)
2. Share yield updates and progress
3. Create engagement incentives (e.g., bonus for active members)
4. Survey members on how to improve
5. Gamify with challenges ("Savings Sprint Month")

### Scenario 4: Dispute Resolution

**Issue**: Members disagree on pool decisions

**Process**:
1. Facilitate open discussion in communication channel
2. Present facts (on-chain data, pool rules)
3. Call for vote if governance allows
4. Implement majority decision
5. Document outcome for transparency

**Prevention**:
- Clear pool rules from day one
- Regular communication
- Fair and transparent decision-making
- Quick response to concerns

## Advanced Pool Features

### Yield Boosters

Activate bonus features for pool:

**Loyalty Bonus**: +0.5% APY for members in pool greater than 90 days

**Size Bonus**: Tiered APY based on total pool size
- 1-5 BTC: Base APY
- 5-10 BTC: +0.3% APY
- 10+ BTC: +0.5% APY

**Activity Bonus**: Extra yield for active governance participation

### Automated Rules

Set up smart contract automation:

**Auto-Rebalance**: Automatically optimize yield strategies monthly

**Scheduled Payouts**: Distribute portion of yield to members quarterly

**Contribution Reminders**: On-chain notifications for deposit goals

### Integration with Other Pools

**Pool-to-Pool Deposits**: Allocate portion of community pool to higher-yield strategies

**Shared Governance**: Link pools for coordinated decision-making

**Pool Network**: Join network of pools for benefits and knowledge sharing

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Create Pool

**Solutions**:
1. Check minimum BTC requirement met
2. Verify wallet connected to Mezo testnet
3. Ensure sufficient balance for creation fee + gas
4. Try different pool name (may be taken)
5. Clear browser cache and retry

### Members Can't Join

**Common Issues**:
1. Pool at capacity → Increase member limit
2. Below minimum deposit → Communicate requirement
3. Not whitelisted → Add their address
4. Wrong network → Guide them to Mezo testnet

### Yield Lower Than Expected

**Reasons**:
1. Recent APY market changes
2. Pool too small for size bonuses
3. High withdrawal activity (reduces compounding)
4. Member deposits too recent

**Check**: Pool analytics for detailed yield breakdown
