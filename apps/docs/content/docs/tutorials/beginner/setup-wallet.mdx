# Setup Your Wallet

Learn how to install and configure MetaMask to connect with KhipuVault on the Mezo testnet.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with Chrome, Firefox, or Brave browser
- Basic understanding of what cryptocurrency wallets are
- 5-10 minutes of time

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Install MetaMask browser extension
- Create a new wallet and secure your seed phrase
- Add Mezo testnet network to MetaMask
- Get testnet tokens for transaction fees
- Connect your wallet to KhipuVault

## Step 1: Install MetaMask

### Download the Extension

1. Visit [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
2. Click "Download" in the top right
3. Select your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave)
4. Click "Install MetaMask for [Your Browser]"
5. Click "Add to [Browser]" in the extension store

<Callout type="warning">
  **Security Alert**: Only download MetaMask from the official website (metamask.io). Never download from third-party sources.
</Callout>

### Verify Installation

After installation, you should see:

- MetaMask fox icon in your browser toolbar
- A welcome screen from MetaMask

## Step 2: Create Your Wallet

### Setup Process

1. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Choose "Create a new wallet"
4. Agree to the terms and conditions
5. Create a strong password (at least 12 characters)
6. Click "Create a new wallet"

<Callout type="info">
  **Password Tip**: Use a unique password you don't use elsewhere. Consider using a password manager like 1Password or Bitwarden.
</Callout>

### Secure Your Seed Phrase

This is the most important step:

1. MetaMask will show you a 12-word seed phrase
2. Click "Reveal Secret Recovery Phrase"
3. **Write down all 12 words in order on paper**
4. Store this paper in a secure location (fireproof safe, safety deposit box)
5. Click "Next"
6. Confirm your seed phrase by selecting words in the correct order
7. Click "Confirm"

<Callout type="error">
  **Critical**: Never share your seed phrase with anyone. KhipuVault will never ask for it. Anyone with your seed phrase can steal all your funds.
</Callout>

### Seed Phrase Best Practices

- Write it on paper, not digitally
- Make 2-3 copies and store in different secure locations
- Never take photos of your seed phrase
- Never store it in email, cloud storage, or messaging apps
- Consider using a metal backup plate for fire/water resistance

## Step 3: Add Mezo Testnet Network

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

1. Visit [app.khipuvault.com](https://app.khipuvault.com)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select MetaMask
4. Approve the connection in MetaMask popup
5. When prompted, click "Add Network" for Mezo testnet
6. Click "Approve" to add the network
7. Click "Switch Network" to use Mezo testnet

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If automatic setup doesn't work:

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown (top center)
3. Click "Add Network"
4. Click "Add a network manually"
5. Enter the following details:

```
Network Name: Mezo Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.test.mezo.org
Chain ID: 31611
Currency Symbol: BTC
Block Explorer URL: https://explorer.test.mezo.org
```

6. Click "Save"
7. Switch to Mezo Testnet in the network dropdown

<Callout type="info">
  **Network Tip**: Always verify you're on Mezo Testnet before making transactions. The network name appears at the top of MetaMask.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Get Testnet Tokens

You need testnet BTC for transaction fees (gas).

### Using the Faucet

1. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask (click the address at top to copy)
2. Visit the [Mezo Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)
3. Paste your wallet address
4. Complete the CAPTCHA
5. Click "Request Testnet BTC"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for tokens to arrive

<Callout type="info">
  **Faucet Limits**: Most faucets have daily limits. You typically receive 0.1-1 testnet BTC, which is plenty for testing.
</Callout>

### Verify Receipt

1. Open MetaMask
2. Check your balance (should show testnet BTC)
3. If you don't see tokens after 5 minutes, try the faucet again

### Alternative Faucets

If the official faucet is down, try these alternatives:

- [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/mezo-testnet)
- [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/mezo/testnet)

## Step 5: Connect to KhipuVault

### First Connection

1. Visit [app.khipuvault.com](https://app.khipuvault.com)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Select "MetaMask" from the wallet options
4. Review the connection request in MetaMask
5. Click "Connect"
6. Approve the network switch to Mezo Testnet if prompted

<Callout type="success">
  **Success**: Your wallet address should now appear in the top right corner of KhipuVault.
</Callout>

### Understanding Permissions

When connecting, you're giving KhipuVault permission to:

- View your wallet address
- Request transaction signatures
- View your token balances

KhipuVault CANNOT:

- Move funds without your approval
- Access your seed phrase or private keys
- Make transactions without your signature

## Troubleshooting

### MetaMask Won't Install

**Problem**: Extension won't add to browser

**Solutions**:
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave)
- Disable other wallet extensions temporarily
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Restart your browser

### Can't See Mezo Testnet

**Problem**: Network doesn't appear in MetaMask

**Solutions**:
- Try manual network setup (see Step 3)
- Verify you entered the Chain ID correctly (31611)
- Update MetaMask to the latest version
- Clear MetaMask activity data: Settings → Advanced → Clear activity tab data

### Faucet Tokens Not Arriving

**Problem**: No testnet BTC after requesting from faucet

**Solutions**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes (blockchain can be slow)
- Verify you're on Mezo Testnet network
- Try an alternative faucet
- Check you copied the correct wallet address

### Connection to KhipuVault Fails

**Problem**: Can't connect wallet to app

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the KhipuVault page
- Disconnect wallet in MetaMask: Settings → Connected sites → Disconnect

## Security Best Practices

- Use different wallets for testing vs. mainnet

### Don'ts
