# Glossary

Quick reference for terms used throughout KhipuVault documentation. Definitions are kept simple and accessible.

<Callout type="info">
**New to crypto?** Start with the basics: [Blockchain](#blockchain), [Wallet](#wallet), [Smart Contract](#smart-contract), and [DeFi](#defi).
</Callout>

## A

### ABI (Application Binary Interface)

A JSON file that describes how to interact with a smart contract - which functions it has, what parameters they take, and what they return.

**Analogy**: Like an instruction manual for talking to a smart contract.

**Example**: KhipuVault's contract ABIs are in the `@khipu/web3` package.

---

### Address

A unique identifier for a wallet or smart contract on the blockchain, usually starting with `0x` followed by 40 hexadecimal characters.

**Example**: `0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393`

**Analogy**: Like an email address or bank account number, but for crypto.

---

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

The yearly return on investment, including compound interest.

**Example**: 15% APY means $100 grows to $115 after one year (if compounded).

**KhipuVault rates**:
- Individual Pools: 12-18% APY
- Community Pools: 15-20% APY

<Callout type="warn">
APY is not guaranteed and can fluctuate based on market conditions.
</Callout>

---

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)

The yearly return without compounding.

**APY vs APR**: APY is always higher than APR when compounding occurs.

---

### Audit (Smart Contract Audit)

A security review of smart contract code by professional security firms to find vulnerabilities.

**Why it matters**: Audited contracts are safer (but not risk-free).

**KhipuVault**: All contracts audited by [CertiK/OpenZeppelin/etc].

---

### Bridge

A system for transferring assets between different blockchains.

**Example**: Moving Bitcoin from Bitcoin L1 to Mezo L2.

**Risk**: Bridges are common attack vectors in crypto. Use audited bridges only.

---

## C

### Censorship Resistance

The property that no single entity can block, freeze, or reverse your transactions.

**Why it matters**: Your money can't be seized like in traditional banking.

[Learn more →](/docs/concepts/decentralization)

---

### Chain ID
