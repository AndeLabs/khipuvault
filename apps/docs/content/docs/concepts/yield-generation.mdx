# Yield Generation

KhipuVault generates yields on your Bitcoin deposits through various DeFi (Decentralized Finance) strategies. This guide explains how your Bitcoin earns returns.

## What Are Yields?

**Yields** are the earnings you receive on your deposited funds - similar to interest from a bank savings account, but typically much higher.

### Simple Analogy

**Traditional Bank**:
- You deposit $1,000
- Bank pays 0.5% annual interest
- After 1 year: You have $1,005 (+$5)

**KhipuVault**:
- You deposit 1,000 MUSD
- Platform generates 15% APY through DeFi
- After 1 year: You have 1,150 MUSD (+150 MUSD)

<Callout type="success" title="Why Higher Yields?">
**Banks**: Take your money, lend it out, keep most profits

**DeFi**: Automated smart contracts, no middlemen, returns go directly to you
</Callout>

## How KhipuVault Generates Yields

KhipuVault uses multiple DeFi strategies to maximize returns while minimizing risk:

```

### The Strategies Explained

## 1. Liquidity Provision

**What it is**: Providing funds to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) so traders can swap tokens.

### How It Works

Imagine a currency exchange booth at an airport:

**Traditional Exchange**:
- Company provides currency inventory
- Charges fees on exchanges
- Company keeps all profits

**DeFi Liquidity Pool**:
- Users provide currency (you!)
- Traders pay fees to swap
- Providers earn those fees

### Example

You deposit 1,000 MUSD into a liquidity pool:

```
Pool: MUSD/BTC
Your share: 1,000 MUSD (1% of pool)

Trader swaps 10,000 MUSD → BTC
Trading fee: 0.3% = 30 MUSD

Your earnings: 1% of 30 = 0.30 MUSD
```

Over a year, thousands of swaps generate significant yields.

### Yields: 8-15% APY

<Callout type="info">
**Risk**: Impermanent loss (if token prices diverge). KhipuVault mitigates this by using stablecoin pairs (MUSD/USDC) where prices don't diverge.
</Callout>

## 2. Lending Protocols

**What it is**: Lending your funds to borrowers who pay interest.

### How It Works

**Traditional Bank Lending**:
```
You deposit → Bank → Bank lends → Borrower
           Bank takes 90% of interest
           You get 0.5% APY
```

**DeFi Lending (e.g., Aave, Compound)**:
```
You deposit → Smart Contract → Borrower
           Smart contract takes 10% fee
           You get 5-12% APY
```

### Example

KhipuVault deposits your MUSD into a lending protocol:

1. Borrowers need MUSD for trading, arbitrage, etc.
2. They deposit collateral (e.g., ETH worth $1,500)
3. They borrow $1,000 MUSD
4. They pay 8% annual interest
5. You earn that interest (minus protocol fee)

### Why People Borrow

- **Traders**: Need liquidity for margin trading
- **Arbitrageurs**: Exploit price differences across exchanges
- **Yield farmers**: Use borrowed funds in other protocols
- **Businesses**: Working capital without selling crypto

### Yields: 5-12% APY

<Callout type="info">
**Safety**: Borrowers must over-collateralize (deposit $1,500 to borrow $1,000). If collateral value drops, smart contract auto-liquidates to protect lenders.
</Callout>

## 3. Staking

**What it is**: Locking tokens to secure a blockchain network and earning rewards.

### How It Works

**Proof-of-Stake** blockchains need validators to process transactions:

```
You stake tokens → Validator uses them → Network rewards you
```

Think of it like:
- **Traditional**: Buying a certificate of deposit (CD) at a bank
- **Staking**: Locking tokens to support network security

### Example

KhipuVault stakes your MUSD in yield-bearing protocols:

1. MUSD is staked in Mezo staking contract
2. Stakers help secure the network
3. Network mints new tokens as rewards
4. Rewards distributed to stakers (you)

### Yields: 10-20% APY

<Callout type="success">
**No risk of loss**: Unlike trading or liquidity pools, staking doesn't expose you to impermanent loss or liquidation risk.
</Callout>

## 4. Yield Aggregation

**What it is**: Automatically moving funds between strategies to maximize yields.

KhipuVault uses a **Yield Aggregator** smart contract that:

1. Monitors yields across multiple protocols
2. Automatically shifts funds to highest-yielding strategies
3. Compounds earnings (reinvests yields)
4. Rebalances to manage risk

### The Power of Compounding

**Without compounding** (simple interest):
```
Year 1: 1,000 MUSD + 15% = 1,150 MUSD
Year 2: 1,000 MUSD + 15% = 1,150 MUSD (+150 more)
Total: 1,300 MUSD
```

**With compounding** (KhipuVault auto-compounds):
```
Year 1: 1,000 MUSD + 15% = 1,150 MUSD
Year 2: 1,150 MUSD + 15% = 1,322.50 MUSD
Total: 1,322.50 MUSD (+22.50 bonus from compounding)
```

Over time, compounding significantly increases returns.

## Understanding APY vs. APR

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)

**Simple interest** - doesn't include compounding.

Example: 12% APR on 1,000 MUSD = 120 MUSD/year

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

**Compound interest** - includes reinvestment of yields.

Example: 12% APR compounded daily = 12.75% APY

**KhipuVault displays APY** because we auto-compound yields.

<Callout type="info" title="Why It Matters">
**APY is always higher than APR** when yields compound. Always compare apples to apples:
- Compare APY to APY
- Or APR to APR

Never compare APY to APR.
</Callout>

## Current Yield Rates

Actual yields vary by product and market conditions:

| Product | Current APY | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Individual Savings** | 12-18% | Lending + Staking |
| **Community Pools** | 15-20% | Liquidity + Lending |
| **ROSCA** | 0% | Social savings (no yields) |
| **Prize Pool** | Variable | Lottery mechanics |

<Callout type="warn">
**APYs are variable** - they change based on:
- Market demand for borrowing
- Liquidity pool trading volume
- Staking rewards
- Protocol incentives

Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
</Callout>

## Where Do Yields Actually Come From?

This is a common question. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. Real Economic Activity

**Lending yields** come from:
- Traders paying interest to borrow
- Arbitrageurs paying for leverage
- Real demand for capital

**Liquidity pool yields** come from:
- Trading fees paid by swappers
- Real trading volume

**Staking yields** come from:
- Network inflation (new token emissions)
- Transaction fees

### 2. Not a Ponzi Scheme

Unlike Ponzi schemes (Bernie Madoff, BitConnect), DeFi yields are:

✅ **Transparent** - all transactions on-chain
✅ **Auditable** - anyone can verify yield sources
✅ **Sustainable** - comes from real economic activity
✅ **Variable** - rates go up and down (Ponzis promise fixed high returns)

❌ **Not guaranteed** - yields can decrease
❌ **Not from new deposits** - comes from trading/borrowing/staking

## Risks of Yield Generation

Every yield strategy has risks. Here's what to know:

### 1. Smart Contract Risk

**Risk**: Bugs in DeFi protocol code could be exploited.

**Mitigation**:
- KhipuVault uses audited protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.)
- Multiple audits on our own contracts
- Insurance protocols available
- Conservative position sizing

[See our security measures →](/docs/concepts/security)

### 2. Market Risk

**Risk**: Token prices could drop (if using non-stablecoin strategies).

**Mitigation**:
- KhipuVault primarily uses stablecoins (MUSD)
- Diversification across strategies
- Risk limits on volatile assets

### 3. Impermanent Loss (Liquidity Pools)

**Risk**: When providing liquidity, if prices diverge, you could lose value.

**Example**:
```
Deposit: 1,000 MUSD + 1 ETH (ETH = $1,000)
Later: ETH rises to $2,000
Result: You'd have more profit just holding ETH
```

**Mitigation**:
- Use stablecoin pairs (MUSD/USDC) - no divergence
- Fees earned often exceed impermanent loss
- Monitor and rebalance

### 4. Protocol Risk

**Risk**: Lending protocol could become insolvent if mass liquidations fail.

**Mitigation**:
- Use blue-chip protocols (Aave, Compound)
- Diversify across protocols
- Monitor protocol health

<Callout type="warn" title="DYOR">
**No investment is risk-free.** DeFi yields are higher than banks because they carry more risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
</Callout>

## FAQ

### Are yields guaranteed?

**No.** Yields fluctuate based on market conditions. While we display estimated APY, actual returns may vary.

### How often are yields paid?

Yields compound **continuously** (every block). You can withdraw anytime and receive all accrued yields.

### Can yields go negative?

Extremely unlikely. Worst case, yields drop to 0%. Your principal is not at risk from yield strategies (only from smart contract exploits, which are mitigated).

### How are yields taxed?

**Depends on your country.** In many jurisdictions, DeFi yields are taxable income. Consult a tax professional.

### What if a DeFi protocol fails?

KhipuVault diversifies across protocols. If one fails, your funds in other protocols are safe. We also use insurance where available.

### Can I choose my own strategies?

Currently, KhipuVault auto-allocates for optimal risk-adjusted returns. Advanced users can request specific strategies (coming soon).
