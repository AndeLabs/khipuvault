## How to Use This Section

### For Beginners

If you're new to cryptocurrency and DeFi, we recommend reading in this order:

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Start with the Glossary

Familiarize yourself with key terms like "DeFi", "APY", "Smart Contract", and "Gas".

[Read Glossary →](/docs/concepts/glossary)

### Understand Bitcoin DeFi

Learn what Bitcoin DeFi is and why it's revolutionary.

[Read Bitcoin DeFi →](/docs/concepts/bitcoin-defi)

### Learn about Mezo

Discover the blockchain that powers KhipuVault.

[Read Mezo Blockchain →](/docs/concepts/mezo-blockchain)

### Explore Smart Contracts

Understand what smart contracts are and why they're trustworthy.

</div>

### For Experienced Users

If you're familiar with crypto, you might want to focus on:

- **[Mezo Blockchain](/docs/concepts/mezo-blockchain)** - Technical details about the Layer-2
- **[Yield Generation](/docs/concepts/yield-generation)** - How yields are generated
- **[Decentralization](/docs/concepts/decentralization)** - Why decentralization matters

## Key Principles Explained

### 🔓 Non-Custodial

**Simple explanation**: You hold your own keys, like keeping cash in your own wallet instead of giving it to a bank.

**Why it matters**: No one can freeze, seize, or control your funds except you.

[Learn more →](/docs/concepts/security#non-custodial-design)

---

### ⛓️ Decentralized

**Simple explanation**: The system runs on thousands of computers worldwide, not one company's server.

**Why it matters**: No single point of failure. No CEO can shut it down.

[Learn more →](/docs/concepts/decentralization)

---

### 👁️ Transparent

**Simple explanation**: All transactions are visible on the blockchain, like a public ledger everyone can audit.

**Why it matters**: You can verify everything yourself. No hidden fees or manipulation.

[Learn more →](/docs/concepts/smart-contracts#transparency)

---

### ₿ Bitcoin-Backed

**Simple explanation**: KhipuVault runs on Mezo, which is secured by Bitcoin's network.

**Why it matters**: You get Bitcoin's security plus smart contract functionality.

## Common Questions

### Do I need to understand all this to use KhipuVault?

**No.** You can use KhipuVault without deep technical knowledge, just like you can drive a car without understanding the engine.

However, understanding the basics will help you:
- Feel more confident
- Make better decisions
- Appreciate the security measures

### Is this like a bank?

**Not exactly.** Banks are centralized institutions that custody your money. KhipuVault is:
- Decentralized (no central authority)
- Non-custodial (you control your keys)
- Transparent (all code is open-source)

Think of it more like a **digital savings vault** you control.

### What if I don't understand blockchain?

That's okay! You don't need to understand blockchain deeply. Here's the simplest explanation:

> **Blockchain** = A shared ledger that everyone can see but no one can cheat.

All the complexity happens in the background. You just need to:
1. Connect your wallet
2. Deposit funds
3. Earn yields
4. Withdraw when you want

### Are there risks?

Yes, like any financial system. We cover:
- **Smart contract risks** in [Smart Contracts](/docs/concepts/smart-contracts)
- **Security measures** in [Security](/docs/concepts/security)
- **Market risks** in [Yield Generation](/docs/concepts/yield-generation)
