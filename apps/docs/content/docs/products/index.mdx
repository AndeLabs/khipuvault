## FAQ

### Can I use multiple products at once?

**Yes!** You can have pools in all four products simultaneously. Many users diversify across products.

### Which product has the highest yields?

**Community Pools** typically offer the highest yields (15-20% APY) due to larger collective deposits. Individual Savings offers 12-18% APY.

**ROSCA** has no yields - it's purely social/community credit.

**Prize Pool** yields vary based on lottery mechanics.

### Can I switch between products?

You can't "convert" a pool to another type, but you can:
1. Withdraw from one product
2. Deposit into another product

For ROSCA, you must wait until your payout turn.

### Which product is safest?

All products use the same audited smart contracts. Safety is equal across all products.

The difference is **liquidity**:
- Individual, Community, Prize Pool → Withdraw anytime
- ROSCA → Locked until your turn
