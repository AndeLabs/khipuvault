## Prize Claim Troubleshooting

### "Prize Not Found"

**Cause**: You didn't win, or wrong week number

**Solution**:
```
1. Double-check winner announcement
2. Verify your address matches
3. Check correct week number
4. Confirm draw has occurred
```

### "Already Claimed"

**Cause**: Prize was already claimed (possibly by you)

**Solution**:
```
1. Check your transaction history
2. Verify MUSD balance increased
3. Contact support if balance unchanged
```

### "Claim Expired"

**Cause**: Tried to claim after 90-day deadline

**Solution**:
```
Unfortunately, expired prizes cannot be recovered.
They're returned to the reserve to fund future prizes.

Prevention: Enable email notifications
```

### "Insufficient Gas"

**Cause**: Not enough MBTC for gas fees

**Solution**:
```
1. Acquire ~0.001 MBTC from Mezo faucet or exchange
2. Send to your wallet
3. Retry claim transaction
```

## Prize Claim Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:

1. **Enable notifications** - Never miss a win
2. **Claim promptly** - Don't risk expiration
3. **Verify on-chain** - Confirm receipt
4. **Batch claims** - Save gas when possible
5. **Consider re-depositing** - Compound your position

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Ignore notifications** - Risk 90-day expiration
2. **Share private keys** - Never needed to claim
3. **Pay claim fees** - KhipuVault never charges claim fees
4. **Trust unverified DMs** - Scammers impersonate support

<Callout type="warning">
**Scam Alert**

KhipuVault will NEVER:
- Ask for your private keys to claim prizes
- Charge claim fees beyond gas
- DM you asking to "verify" your wallet
- Request payment to release prizes

Only claim through app.khipuvault.com or official smart contracts.
