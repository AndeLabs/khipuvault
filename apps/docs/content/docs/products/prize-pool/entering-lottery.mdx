# Entering the Lottery

Learn how to participate in Prize Pool and maximize your lottery entries while keeping your principal safe.

## Prerequisites

Before entering Prize Pool, ensure you have:

1. **Mezo-compatible wallet** (MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet)
2. **MUSD balance** (Mezo's stablecoin)
3. **Small amount of MBTC** (for gas fees)

<Callout type="info">
**Don't have MUSD?**

You can mint MUSD from BTC on Mezo or swap on [MezoSwap](https://swap.mezo.org). See [Getting MUSD](/docs/getting-started/getting-musd) for details.
</Callout>

## Step-by-Step: Entering Prize Pool

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

Navigate to the Prize Pool page:

```
https://app.khipuvault.com/prize-pool
```

Click **"Connect Wallet"** and approve the connection.

**Supported wallets:**
- MetaMask
- Rabby
- Coinbase Wallet
- WalletConnect-compatible wallets

### 2. Review Current Prize

Before depositing, check the current week's prize:

```
Current Week Prize Pool: 5,750 MUSD
- Grand Prize: 4,600 MUSD
- Runner-Up: 862 MUSD (5 winners)
- Consolation: 287 MUSD (10 winners)

Next Draw: Friday, 12:00 PM UTC (in 3 days)
Total Participants: 1,247
Your Odds (if you deposit 1,000 MUSD): ~0.05%
```

### 3. Deposit MUSD

Click **"Deposit"** and enter your amount:

```
Deposit Amount: [1000] MUSD

You will receive:
- ~1,000 lottery tickets
- Participation in all future draws
- Right to withdraw anytime

Estimated odds:
- Grand Prize: 1 in 2,000
- Any Prize: 1 in 125
```

**Deposit Options:**
- **Minimum**: 10 MUSD (to prevent spam)
- **Maximum**: No limit
- **Incremental**: Deposit multiple times to increase tickets

### 4. Approve Transaction

Two transactions required:

**Transaction 1: Approve MUSD**
```
Approve KhipuVault Prize Pool to spend MUSD
Gas: ~0.0001 MBTC
```

**Transaction 2: Deposit**
```
Deposit 1,000 MUSD into Prize Pool
Gas: ~0.0002 MBTC
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Gas Optimization Tip**

Approve unlimited MUSD spending to avoid repeated approval transactions. This is safe because you control withdrawals.
</Callout>

### 5. Confirm Your Entry

After deposit confirms (~5 seconds on Mezo), you'll see:

```
✅ Deposit Successful!

Your Stats:
- Balance: 1,000 MUSD
- Lottery Tickets: 1,000
- Eligible Draws: All future draws starting Friday
- Next Draw: In 3 days, 4 hours

Your Odds:
- Grand Prize: 0.05% (1 in 2,000)
- Runner-Up: 0.25% (1 in 400)
- Any Prize: 0.8% (1 in 125)
```

## Understanding Your Tickets

### Ticket Allocation

Tickets are calculated based on:

1. **Deposit amount** (1 MUSD ≈ 1 ticket)
2. **Time-weighted average** (longer deposits = more tickets)

**Example:**

```
Scenario A: Deposit 1,000 MUSD on Monday
By Friday draw: 1,000 tickets (full week)

Scenario B: Deposit 1,000 MUSD on Thursday
By Friday draw: ~285 tickets (2 days out of 7)
```

<Callout type="info">
**Time-Weighting Explained**

Your tickets are calculated using a time-weighted average to prevent "sniping" (depositing right before draws). Longer deposits earn proportionally more tickets.

Formula: `Tickets = Balance × (Days Deposited ÷ 7)`
</Callout>

### Increasing Your Tickets

**Option 1: Deposit More**
```
Initial: 1,000 MUSD = 1,000 tickets
Add 500 MUSD = 1,500 total tickets
```

**Option 2: Deposit Earlier**
```
Deposit Monday: Full week time-weight
Deposit Thursday: Partial week time-weight
```

**Option 3: Keep Deposited**
```
Week 1: 1,000 tickets
Week 2: 1,000 tickets (cumulative)
Week 52: 1,000 tickets (still eligible)
```

### Ticket Tracking

View your tickets in real-time:

```
My Prize Pool Dashboard

Balance: 2,500 MUSD
Current Tickets: 2,500
Time in Pool: 14 days

Ticket History:
- Week 1: 714 tickets (deposited Thursday)
- Week 2: 2,500 tickets (full week)
- Week 3: 2,500 tickets (projected)
```

## Draw Eligibility

### When Are You Eligible?

You're eligible for a draw if:
- ✅ You have MUSD deposited at draw time
- ✅ Your deposit has been in the pool for at least 1 block
- ✅ You have at least 10 MUSD (minimum threshold)

You're NOT eligible if:
- ❌ You withdrew before the draw
- ❌ Your balance is below 10 MUSD
- ❌ Your deposit occurred after the draw snapshot

### Draw Schedule

Draws occur **every Friday at 12:00 PM UTC**.

**Timeline:**
```
Monday 12:00 PM UTC: Week begins
Tuesday-Thursday: Deposits accrue time-weight
Friday 11:59 AM UTC: Snapshot taken
Friday 12:00 PM UTC: Draw executes
Friday 12:01 PM UTC: Winners announced
```

**Important:**
- Deposits after snapshot don't count for current draw
- Early week deposits have higher time-weight

## Depositing Strategies

### Conservative Approach

Deposit a comfortable amount and leave it:

```
Deposit: 1,000 MUSD
Strategy: Set and forget
Duration: 52 weeks (1 year)
Draws entered: 52
Cost: 0 MUSD (no-loss)
Potential upside: 52 chances to win
```

### Aggressive Approach

Maximize tickets through larger deposits:

```
Deposit: 10,000 MUSD
Strategy: Large position for better odds
Duration: 12 weeks (3 months)
Draws entered: 12
Your odds: 10x higher than 1,000 MUSD deposit
```

### Dollar-Cost Averaging

Gradually build position:

```
Week 1: Deposit 500 MUSD
Week 2: Deposit 500 MUSD (1,000 total)
Week 3: Deposit 500 MUSD (1,500 total)
Week 4: Deposit 500 MUSD (2,000 total)

Benefits:
- Spread out gas costs
- Average entry price (if MUSD fluctuates)
- Build tickets over time
```

## Managing Your Entry

### Adding to Your Position

Click **"Deposit"** again to add funds:

```
Current Balance: 1,000 MUSD
Additional Deposit: 500 MUSD
New Balance: 1,500 MUSD
New Tickets: ~1,500 (depends on time-weight)
```

### Withdrawing (Partially)

You can withdraw part of your balance:

```
Current Balance: 2,000 MUSD
Withdraw: 500 MUSD
Remaining Balance: 1,500 MUSD
Remaining Tickets: ~1,500

Effect: Reduces your odds but keeps you in draws
```

### Withdrawing (Fully)

Exit Prize Pool completely:

```
Current Balance: 2,000 MUSD
Withdraw: 2,000 MUSD
Remaining Balance: 0 MUSD
Tickets: 0

Effect: No longer eligible for draws
Note: Can claim any unclaimed prizes separately
```

## Entry Limits and Rules

### Minimum Deposit
```
Minimum: 10 MUSD
Reason: Prevent spam and dust accounts
```

### Maximum Deposit
```
Maximum: No limit
Note: Large deposits improve odds but don't guarantee wins
```

### Multiple Entries

You can deposit from multiple wallets:

```
Wallet A: 1,000 MUSD
Wallet B: 1,000 MUSD

```

## Entry Checklist

Before entering Prize Pool:

- [ ] I have a Mezo-compatible wallet connected
- [ ] I have at least 10 MUSD to deposit
- [ ] I have MBTC for gas fees (~0.0003 MBTC)
- [ ] I understand my deposit is always withdrawable
- [ ] I know my tickets are based on deposit amount and time
- [ ] I'm comfortable with opportunity cost (foregoing direct yields)

## Common Entry Mistakes

### ❌ Depositing Right Before Draw

```
Thursday 11:00 PM UTC: Deposit 1,000 MUSD
Friday 12:00 PM UTC: Draw occurs
Your tickets: ~83 (1 day out of 7)

Better: Deposit Monday for full time-weight
```

### ❌ Withdrawing Before Draw

```
Thursday: Withdraw all funds
Friday: Draw occurs
Your tickets: 0 (not eligible)

Better: Wait until after draw to withdraw
```

### ❌ Depositing Below Minimum

```
Deposit: 5 MUSD
Result: Transaction reverts (minimum 10 MUSD)

Better: Deposit at least 10 MUSD
```

### ❌ Not Checking Odds

```
Your deposit: 10 MUSD
Total pool: 2,000,000 MUSD
Your odds: 0.0005% (extremely low)

Better: Deposit more or understand your odds
```
