# Prize Pool (No-Loss Lottery)

Save money, win prizes, never lose your deposit. The Prize Pool is a revolutionary no-loss lottery where your principal is always protected.

## What is Prize Pool?

Prize Pool combines the excitement of a lottery with the safety of a savings account. You deposit MUSD, earn lottery tickets based on your balance, and compete for weekly prizes funded entirely by yield. **Your deposit is never at risk.**

**Key Features:**
- 🎰 **No-loss guarantee** - Withdraw your full deposit anytime
- 🎟️ **Automatic tickets** - More savings = better odds
- 🏆 **Weekly prizes** - Multiple winners every week
- 💰 **Yield-funded** - Prizes come from collective interest
- ⚡ **Fair & transparent** - Verifiable randomness on-chain
- 🔄 **Unlimited entries** - Stay deposited, enter every draw

## How It Works (Simple Version)

```
1. Deposit MUSD → 2. Earn Tickets → 3. Weekly Draw → 4. Win Prizes → 5. Keep Deposit
```

1. **Deposit MUSD** - Your balance becomes lottery tickets
2. **Earn yields** - Your deposit generates interest (pooled with all players)
3. **Weekly draw** - Random selection picks winners from all tickets
4. **Win prizes** - Prizes funded from collective yields
5. **Withdraw anytime** - Get your full deposit back, plus any winnings

## Why Choose Prize Pool?

### ✅ Best For:
- Savers who enjoy the thrill of winning
- People who buy lottery tickets regularly
- Building savings with excitement
- Learning DeFi with minimal risk

## Real Example

**Scenario**: You deposit 1,000 MUSD into Prize Pool

**What happens:**
- You receive ~1,000 lottery tickets (1 MUSD ≈ 1 ticket)
- Your deposit earns ~15% APY (180 MUSD/year)
- Your yield goes into the weekly prize pool
- You participate in 52 weekly draws automatically
- If you don't win, withdraw your full 1,000 MUSD anytime
- If you win, withdraw 1,000 MUSD + your prize

**Cost to you**: Zero (except opportunity cost of yields)

**Upside**: Win 100-10,000+ MUSD prizes

## Safety First

<Callout type="warning">
**Principal Protection Guarantee**

Your deposit is held in audited smart contracts and NEVER used to fund prizes. Only the yields generated by deposits fund the prize pool. You can verify your balance on-chain at any time.

**What you risk:** Potential yields (opportunity cost)
**What you CAN'T lose:** Your principal deposit
