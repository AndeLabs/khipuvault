# Odds & Strategies

Learn how to improve your odds, optimize your deposits, and develop winning strategies for Prize Pool.

## Understanding Your Odds

### Basic Probability

Your odds are proportional to your ticket share:

```
Your Odds = Your Tickets ÷ Total Tickets

Example:
- Your tickets: 1,000
- Total tickets: 2,000,000
- Your odds: 0.05% (1 in 2,000)
```

This applies to each prize tier independently.

### Prize-Specific Odds

Different tiers have different odds:

```
Grand Prize (1 winner):
Your odds: Your Tickets ÷ Total Tickets

Runner-Up (5 winners):
Your odds: 5 × (Your Tickets ÷ Total Tickets)

Consolation (10 winners):
Your odds: 10 × (Your Tickets ÷ Total Tickets)
```

**Example with 1,000 tickets out of 2,000,000 total:**
```
Grand Prize odds: 0.05% (1 in 2,000)
Runner-Up odds: 0.25% (1 in 400)
Consolation odds: 0.50% (1 in 200)
Any prize odds: 0.80% (1 in 125)
```

### Cumulative Odds (Multiple Draws)

Your odds improve over multiple draws:

```
Probability of winning at least once in N draws:
= 1 - (1 - P)^N

Where P = single-draw probability
```

**Example (0.8% odds per draw):**
```
1 draw: 0.80% chance
10 draws: 7.7% chance
52 draws: 34.0% chance (over 1 year)
100 draws: 55.1% chance
```

<Callout type="success">
**Time Improves Odds**

Staying deposited for 52 weeks (1 year) gives you a 34% chance of winning at least one prize, assuming 0.8% odds per draw.
</Callout>

## Improving Your Odds

### Strategy 1: Deposit More

The most direct way to improve odds:

```
Scenario A: 1,000 MUSD deposit
- Tickets: 1,000
- Odds: 0.05%
- Expected value per draw: 5.2 MUSD

Scenario B: 10,000 MUSD deposit
- Tickets: 10,000
- Odds: 0.5%
- Expected value per draw: 52 MUSD

10x deposit → 10x odds
```

**Optimal deposit size depends on:**
- Your risk tolerance
- Opportunity cost of yields
- Desire for excitement vs. stability

### Strategy 2: Deposit Early in Week

Maximize time-weighted tickets:

```
Monday Deposit:
- Time in pool: 7 days
- Time weight: 100%
- Effective tickets: 1,000

Thursday Deposit:
- Time in pool: 2 days
- Time weight: 28.5%
- Effective tickets: 285

Same deposit, 3.5x more tickets by depositing Monday!
```

<Callout type="info">
**Best Practice**

Deposit on Monday (or right after Friday draw) to maximize your time-weighted tickets for that week.
</Callout>

### Strategy 3: Stay Deposited Longer

Compound probability over time:

```
Strategy A: Deposit for 1 week
- Draws entered: 1
- Cumulative odds: 0.8%

Strategy B: Deposit for 52 weeks
- Draws entered: 52
- Cumulative odds: 34.0%

42x more likely to win by staying deposited!
```

**Trade-off:**
- Longer deposit = more draws = higher cumulative odds
- But opportunity cost increases (missed yields on other platforms)

### Strategy 4: Re-deposit Winnings

Compound your position:

```
Week 1: Deposit 1,000 MUSD
Week 10: Win 155 MUSD (Runner-Up)
Action: Re-deposit 155 MUSD

Week 11+:
- New deposit: 1,155 MUSD
- New tickets: 1,155
- New odds: 15.5% higher
```

**Long-term compounding:**
```
Start: 1,000 MUSD
Win 1: +155 MUSD → 1,155 MUSD deposit
Win 2: +25 MUSD → 1,180 MUSD deposit
Win 3: +155 MUSD → 1,335 MUSD deposit

After 3 wins: 33.5% larger position
```

### Strategy 5: Pool with Friends

Coordinate deposits with friends/family:

```
Solo Strategy:
- You deposit: 1,000 MUSD
- Your odds: 0.05%

Group Strategy (5 friends):
- Each deposits: 1,000 MUSD
- Group odds: 0.25% (5x better)
- Agreement: Split winnings 5 ways
```

**Benefits:**
- Higher odds of someone winning
- Share the excitement
- Diversify risk across group

**Risks:**
- Trust required (no smart contract enforcement)
- Potential disputes over winnings

## Advanced Strategies

### Kelly Criterion

Optimal bet sizing based on expected value:

```
Kelly % = (Expected Value ÷ Prize) - ((1 - Probability) ÷ Probability)

Example:
- Expected value: 5.2 MUSD
- Grand prize: 4,153 MUSD
- Probability: 0.05%
- Kelly %: ~0.13% of bankroll

If bankroll = 100,000 MUSD
Optimal deposit = 130 MUSD
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Kelly Criterion Limitations**

Kelly assumes infinite repeated trials. For Prize Pool:
- Limited draws (52/year)
- No-loss principal (reduces risk)
- Non-binary outcomes (multiple prize tiers)

Use Kelly as a guide, not gospel.
</Callout>

### Expected Value Maximization

Deposit enough to make expected value > opportunity cost:

```
Goal: Expected Value > Direct Yields

Direct Yield (15% APY):
1,000 MUSD × 15% ÷ 52 = 2.88 MUSD/week

Prize Pool Expected Value:
With 1,000 tickets out of 2M total = 5.22 MUSD/week

EV Premium: 5.22 - 2.88 = +2.34 MUSD (+81%)

Conclusion: Prize Pool has higher expected value
```

**Break-even analysis:**
```
At what ticket share does EV = Direct Yields?

If EV less than 2.88 MUSD, direct yields are better
If EV more than 2.88 MUSD, Prize Pool is better

Calculate your personal break-even based on ticket share
```

### Portfolio Allocation

Diversify across KhipuVault products:

```
Total Assets: 10,000 MUSD

Conservative Allocation:
- 70% Individual Savings: 7,000 MUSD (guaranteed ~15% APY)
- 20% Prize Pool: 2,000 MUSD (high variance, high EV)
- 10% Liquid: 1,000 MUSD (emergency fund)

Aggressive Allocation:
- 30% Individual Savings: 3,000 MUSD
- 60% Prize Pool: 6,000 MUSD (maximize odds)
- 10% Liquid: 1,000 MUSD

Balanced Allocation:
- 50% Individual Savings: 5,000 MUSD
- 40% Prize Pool: 4,000 MUSD
- 10% Liquid: 1,000 MUSD
```

Choose based on:
- Risk tolerance (conservative vs. aggressive)
- Liquidity needs
- Preference for excitement vs. stability

## Odds by Deposit Size

Real examples at current pool size (2M MUSD total):

| Deposit | Tickets | Grand Prize Odds | Any Prize Odds | Annual Win Probability |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 100 | 100 | 0.005% (1 in 20,000) | 0.08% (1 in 1,250) | 4.0% |
| 500 | 500 | 0.025% (1 in 4,000) | 0.40% (1 in 250) | 18.3% |
| 1,000 | 1,000 | 0.05% (1 in 2,000) | 0.80% (1 in 125) | 34.0% |
| 5,000 | 5,000 | 0.25% (1 in 400) | 4.0% (1 in 25) | 89.3% |
| 10,000 | 10,000 | 0.50% (1 in 200) | 8.0% (1 in 12.5) | 98.9% |
| 50,000 | 50,000 | 2.5% (1 in 40) | 40% (1 in 2.5) | greater than 99.9% |

**Key insights:**
- 10,000 MUSD deposit = 99% chance to win something within 1 year
- 50,000 MUSD deposit = near-guaranteed weekly prizes

## Common Strategy Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Depositing Right Before Draw

```
Wrong: Thursday 11 PM UTC deposit
- Time weight: ~14% (1 day out of 7)
- Wasted ticket potential: 86%

Right: Monday deposit
- Time weight: 100%
- Full ticket credit
```

**Impact:**
```
Same 1,000 MUSD deposit:
- Thursday: 140 tickets
- Monday: 1,000 tickets
7x more tickets by depositing Monday!
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Withdrawing Too Soon

```
Wrong: Deposit for 1 week, no win, withdraw
- Draws entered: 1
- Cumulative odds: 0.8%

Right: Deposit for 52 weeks (1 year)
- Draws entered: 52
- Cumulative odds: 34.0%

42x more likely to win by staying!
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Underestimating Opportunity Cost

```
Wrong: Deposit 100,000 MUSD into Prize Pool
- Expected value: 520 MUSD/week
- Direct yields foregone: 288 MUSD/week
- Net EV: +232 MUSD/week

But: Volatility risk (might win 0 for months)

Right: Deposit 20,000 MUSD, keep 80,000 in Individual Savings
- Prize Pool EV: 104 MUSD/week
- Direct yields: 230 MUSD/week
- Total: 334 MUSD/week (higher + less volatile)
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Pool Growth

```
Wrong: "Odds are too low, I'll wait"
- Pool grows from 2M → 5M MUSD
- Prize grows 2.5x but your odds halve
- Net: Worse position

Right: Deposit early before pool grows
- Lock in higher ticket share
- Benefit from growing prizes
- Better expected value
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Re-depositing Wins

```
Scenario: Win 155 MUSD, withdraw to wallet

Missed opportunity:
- Re-deposit would increase tickets 15.5%
- Higher odds for future draws
- Compounding effect over time

Better: Re-deposit winnings to compound position
```

## Psychological Strategies

### Manage Expectations

```
Realistic Mindset:
- "I might not win for months, but my deposit is safe"
- "Over 52 weeks, I have a 34% chance to win something"
- "Expected value is positive, even if I don't win"

Unrealistic Mindset:
- "I'll definitely win this week"
- "If I don't win in 10 draws, I'm withdrawing"
- "Prize Pool is a scam because I didn't win"
```

### Set Goals

```
Goal A: "Win at least one prize within 1 year"
- Deposit: 1,000 MUSD
- Probability: 34%
- Achievable with patience

Goal B: "Win the Grand Prize"
- Deposit: 1,000 MUSD
- Probability: 2.5% over 52 weeks
- Possible but unlikely

Set realistic goals aligned with your odds.
```

### Dollar-Cost Average

Gradually build position:

```
Week 1: Deposit 200 MUSD
Week 2: Deposit 200 MUSD (400 total)
Week 3: Deposit 200 MUSD (600 total)
...
Week 5: Deposit 200 MUSD (1,000 total)

Benefits:
- Easier psychologically (small commitments)
- Average entry price
- Learn the system gradually
```
