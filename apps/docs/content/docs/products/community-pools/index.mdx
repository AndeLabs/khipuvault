# Community Pools

Save together, grow together. Create or join community-driven savings pools where groups pool resources, share yields, and make decisions collectively.

## What are Community Pools?

Community Pools are collaborative savings vehicles where groups of people deposit funds together, earn collective yields, and govern the pool democratically. Think of it as a credit union on blockchain.

**Key Features:**
- 🤝 **Group savings** - Pool resources with others
- 🗳️ **Democratic governance** - Vote on pool decisions
- 📈 **Collective yields** - 12-18% APY on pooled funds
- 👥 **Member management** - Add/remove members by vote
- 🔍 **Full transparency** - All transactions on-chain
- 💪 **Stronger together** - Bigger pools = better opportunities

## How It Works

```
Community → Create Pool → Members Join → Deposit Together → Earn Yields → Govern Collectively
```

1. **Create or join a pool** - Start your own or join existing
2. **Deposit MUSD** - Each member contributes their share
3. **Yields accumulate** - Pool earns on total deposited amount
4. **Make decisions** - Vote on withdrawals, new members, strategies
5. **Withdraw when needed** - With member approval

## Current Returns

<Callout type="success">
**Current APY**: 12-18% (varies by market conditions)

**Platform Fee**: 10% of yields (pool keeps 90%)

**Example**: 10 members × 1,000 MUSD = 10,000 MUSD pool → Earn ~1,620 MUSD/year (after fees)
