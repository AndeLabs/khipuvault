# Joining a Community Pool

Join existing community pools to participate in collective savings, benefit from group governance, and earn yields together.

## Why Join an Existing Pool?

### Benefits of Joining vs Creating

**Joining existing pools:**
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry (no deployment costs)
- ✅ Established community and track record
- ✅ Existing yields already generating
- ✅ Learn governance by observing

**Creating new pools:**
- ✅ Full control over parameters
- ✅ Choose your members
- ✅ Set your own rules
- ✅ Admin privileges

<Callout type="info">
**Recommendation**: Join existing pools first to understand how they work, then create your own once you're comfortable.
