# Pool Management

Master the tools and strategies to effectively manage your community pool, from member onboarding to financial oversight and governance coordination.

## Admin Roles & Permissions

Community pools can have different administrative structures:

### Founder/Creator Role

The pool creator automatically becomes the first admin with special privileges:

```typescript
Founder Permissions:
- Add/remove initial members (before first vote)
- Approve join requests (Hybrid pools)
- Create proposals
- Vote on all matters
- Update pool metadata
- Emergency pause (if compromised)
- Transfer admin to multi-sig (recommended)
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Security Best Practice**: Transfer admin rights to a multi-sig wallet within the first week. This prevents single-point-of-failure risks.
</Callout>

### Multi-Sig Admin (Recommended)

Set up shared admin control:

```
3-of-5 Multi-Sig
- Requires 3 signatures for admin actions
- Protects against single compromised wallet
- Distributes trust among trusted members
- Standard for pools >$10k
```

**How to set up:**
1. Create proposal: "Transfer admin to multi-sig"
2. Deploy Gnosis Safe or similar
3. Add 5 trusted member addresses
4. Set threshold: 3-of-5 required
5. Vote to approve transfer

### Role-Based Access (Advanced)

Larger pools can implement tiered roles:

| Role | Permissions | Who Gets It |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Founder** | Full control initially | Pool creator |
| **Admin** | Approve members, pause pool | Elected by vote |
| **Moderator** | Review proposals, manage Discord | Appointed by admins |
| **Member** | Vote, propose, deposit, withdraw | All members |
| **Observer** | View only, no voting | Public/visitors |

## Member Management

## Common Management Challenges

### Challenge 1: Low Engagement

- Few proposal creations
- Quiet Discord/communication channels

**Solutions:**
- Reduce voting period (7d → 3d)
- Lower quorum requirement
- Create engaging proposals
- Host virtual meetups
- Reward active participants
- Simplify voting process

### Challenge 2: Rapid Growth

**Symptoms:**

- Governance becoming slow
- Communication overwhelming

**Solutions:**

- Increase minimum deposit
- Switch from Open to Hybrid
- Add moderators to help
- Implement tiered governance
- Create onboarding automation

### Challenge 3: Financial Stress

**Symptoms:**
- High withdrawal rate
- Declining deposits
- Members leaving

**Solutions:**
- Communicate transparently about causes
- Review and possibly increase withdrawal limits
- Create retention incentives
- Address underlying issues (low yields, disputes)
- Consider merger with another pool
- Emergency liquidity measures

### Challenge 4: Governance Gridlock

**Symptoms:**
- Proposals failing to reach quorum
- Highly controversial votes
- Faction formation

**Solutions:**
- Facilitate open discussions
- Use mediators for disputes
- Break complex proposals into smaller ones
- Adjust quorum requirements
- Implement weighted voting if appropriate
- Create conflict resolution process

## Tools & Integrations

### Recommended Tools

**Communication:**
- Discord/Telegram - Real-time chat
- EmailOctopus - Email campaigns
- Twitter - Public updates

### Smart Contract Tools

**For Advanced Admins:**

```typescript
// Read pool data programmatically
import { cooperativePoolABI } from '@khipu/web3';

const pool = new ethers.Contract(
  poolAddress,
  cooperativePoolABI,
  provider
);

// Get pool statistics
const stats = await pool.getPoolStats();
console.log('Total Members:', stats.totalMembers);
console.log('Total Deposits:', ethers.formatUnits(stats.totalDeposits, 18));

// Monitor events
pool.on('MemberAdded', (member, timestamp) => {
  console.log(`New member: ${member}`);
  // Send welcome message
});

pool.on('ProposalCreated', (proposalId, creator, title) => {
  console.log(`New proposal #${proposalId}: ${title}`);
  // Notify members
});
```

## Emergency Procedures

### When to Pause the Pool

Pause in these situations:
- 🚨 Smart contract vulnerability discovered
- 🚨 Suspicious activity detected
- 🚨 Coordinated attack on pool
- 🚨 Major bug in yield calculation
- 🚨 Governance compromise

**How to Pause:**
1. Admin calls `emergencyPause()` function
2. All deposits/withdrawals frozen
3. Yields continue accumulating
4. Members notified immediately
5. Issue investigation begins

**Communication Template:**
```
🚨 POOL PAUSED - IMPORTANT NOTICE

The pool has been temporarily paused due to [reason].

What this means:
- Deposits are temporarily disabled
- Withdrawals are temporarily disabled
- Your funds remain safe and yields continue
- We are investigating and will update within 24h

What you should do:
- Stay calm - your funds are safe
- Do NOT sign any suspicious transactions
- Join emergency Discord call: [link]
- Check for updates every 6 hours

We will resolve this as quickly as possible.
- Pool Admin Team
```

### Recovery Plan

After emergency is resolved:

1. **Identify root cause**
2. **Implement fix** (smart contract upgrade if needed)
3. **Test thoroughly** on testnet
4. **Community vote** to unpause
5. **Gradual unpause** (withdrawals first, then deposits)
6. **Post-mortem report** published
7. **Compensation** if members were harmed

## Scaling Your Pool

### Growth Milestones

**10 Members → 25 Members**
- Focus: Building core community
- Challenge: Establishing culture
- Action: Clear guidelines, active engagement

**25 Members → 50 Members**
- Focus: Governance optimization
- Challenge: Maintaining participation
- Action: Add moderators, streamline voting

**50 Members → 100 Members**
- Focus: Operational efficiency
- Challenge: Communication overhead
- Action: Automation, better tooling

**100+ Members**
- Focus: Decentralization
- Challenge: Complexity
- Action: Multi-sig admin, tiered roles, sub-committees

### When to Split a Pool

Consider creating sub-pools when:
- Pool exceeds 200 members (governance becomes unwieldy)
- Clear factions emerge (different goals)
- Geographic distribution creates time zone issues
- Specialized use cases develop

**Example Split:**
```
Original: "Lima Community Pool" (250 members)
    ↓
Split into:
- "Lima North Community Pool" (125 members)
- "Lima South Community Pool" (125 members)
- Both pools maintain cooperation agreement
```
