# Governance & Voting

Learn how to participate in community pool governance, create proposals, vote on decisions, and ensure democratic, transparent management.

## What is Pool Governance?

Governance is how community pools make collective decisions. Unlike individual pools where you have full control, community pools require member consensus for important actions.

**Governed by Smart Contracts:**
```
Traditional Organizations          Community Pools (KhipuVault)
─────────────────────              ────────────────────────────
✗ Trust board members              ✓ Trust code (transparent)
✗ Opaque decision-making           ✓ All votes on-chain
✗ Can change rules arbitrarily     ✓ Rules enforced by contract
✗ Manual vote counting             ✓ Automatic execution
```

### Voting Systems

Community pools support two main voting mechanisms:

#### 1. Democratic Voting (One Person, One Vote)

**How it works:**
```solidity
// Each member gets exactly 1 vote
mapping(address => uint256) public votes;

function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    require(isMember(msg.sender), "Not a member");
    votes[proposalId][msg.sender] = support ? 1 : 0;
}
```

**Best for:**
- Neighborhood associations
- Churches and religious groups
- Family funds
- Sports teams
- Any group valuing equality

**Pros:**
- ✅ Everyone has equal say
- ✅ Prevents wealth concentration
- ✅ Encourages participation
- ✅ Builds community

**Cons:**
- ❌ New members have same power as founders
- ❌ Small contributors equal to large ones
- ❌ May not reflect financial risk

**Example:**
```
Proposal: "Distribute 1,000 MUSD to member emergency fund"

Member A (Balance: 5,000 MUSD) → Vote: YES (weight: 1)
Member B (Balance: 100 MUSD)   → Vote: YES (weight: 1)
Member C (Balance: 2,000 MUSD) → Vote: NO (weight: 1)

Result: 2 YES, 1 NO → Passes (67% approval)
```

#### 2. Weighted Voting (Vote Power by Contribution)

**How it works:**
```solidity
// Vote weight proportional to deposit
function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    uint256 weight = memberBalance[msg.sender];
    votes[proposalId][msg.sender] = support ? weight : 0;
}
```

**Best for:**
- Investment clubs
- Professional networks
- Large diverse pools
- Business cooperatives

**Pros:**
- ✅ Reflects financial stake
- ✅ Larger contributors have more say
- ✅ Aligns risk with control
- ✅ Incentivizes larger deposits

**Cons:**
- ❌ Wealth can dominate
- ❌ Small members feel powerless
- ❌ Can create inequality
- ❌ Risk of centralization

**Example:**
```
Proposal: "Invest 50% of pool in higher-risk strategy"

Member A (5,000 MUSD)  → Vote: YES (weight: 5,000)
Member B (100 MUSD)    → Vote: NO (weight: 100)
Member C (2,000 MUSD)  → Vote: NO (weight: 2,000)
Total Pool: 10,000 MUSD

YES: 5,000 MUSD (50%)
NO: 2,100 MUSD (21%)
Abstain: 2,900 MUSD (29%)

Result: Passes (50% > 49%)
```

<Callout type="info">
**Hybrid Option**: Some pools use weighted voting for financial decisions and democratic for member/governance decisions.
</Callout>

## Creating Proposals

Any member can create proposals (unless restricted). Here's how:

### Proposal Types

<div className="fd-steps [[[<Steps>_h3]_h3]_h3]:fd-step">

### 1. Add Member Proposal

**When to use:** Invite new person to closed pool

```yaml
Proposal Type: Add Member
Title: "Add Maria Garcia to Pool"

Details:
  New Member Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
  Name: Maria Garcia
  Justification: |
    Maria is a Villa Esperanza resident for 10 years.
    Active in neighborhood association. Referred by Juan Rodriguez.
    Will contribute 200 MUSD initially.

  Verification:
    - Email: maria@example.com ✓
    - Referral: Juan Rodriguez (Member #12) ✓
    - Background: Clean ✓

Voting Period: 3 days
Required Approval: 60%
Quorum: 51%
```

### 2. Remove Member Proposal

**When to use:** Member violates rules, inactive, or voluntary exit with notice

```yaml
Proposal Type: Remove Member
Title: "Remove Carlos Mendez for Inactivity"

Details:
  Member to Remove: Carlos Mendez (0x8626...1199)
  Member ID: #33

  Reason: |
    Carlos has not voted on any proposal in 120 days (last vote: Feb 15).
    Sent 3 reminder emails - no response.
    Has not made deposits in 180 days.
    Pool rules require active participation.

  Member's Balance: 50 MUSD + 4 MUSD yields
  Withdrawal Timeline: 30 days after approval

  Grace Period: 7 days to contest this proposal

Voting Period: 5 days (longer for removals)
Required Approval: 70% (higher threshold for removals)
Quorum: 60%
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Fairness Requirement**: Removed members always keep their funds. They have 30 days to withdraw after approval.
</Callout>

### 3. Withdraw Funds Proposal

**When to use:** Large pool-level withdrawal or emergency distribution

```yaml
Proposal Type: Withdraw Pool Funds
Title: "Emergency Distribution for Community Crisis"

Details:
  Amount: 5,000 MUSD (4% of pool)

  Purpose: |
    Severe flooding in Villa Esperanza neighborhood.
    12 member families affected, need immediate assistance.
    Distribute 400 MUSD to each affected family.

  Distribution:
    - Family 1 (Member #5): 400 MUSD
    - Family 2 (Member #12): 400 MUSD
    - ... (10 more families)

  Timeline: Immediate upon approval

  Impact on Pool:
    - Total Pool: 125,000 → 120,000 MUSD (-4%)
    - Estimated yield impact: -0.58% APY reduction
    - Recovery time: ~3 months

Voting Period: 24 hours (emergency fast-track)
Required Approval: 51%
Quorum: 40% (lower for emergencies)
```

### 4. Change Parameters Proposal

**When to use:** Adjust pool settings

```yaml
Proposal Type: Change Pool Parameters
Title: "Increase Minimum Deposit to 100 MUSD"

Current Settings:
  Minimum Deposit: 50 MUSD
  Individual Withdrawal Limit: 10%
  Voting Period: 3 days
  Quorum: 51%

Proposed Changes:
  Minimum Deposit: 50 → 100 MUSD

Justification: |
  Pool has grown to 45 members. Higher minimum will:
  1. Attract more committed members
  2. Reduce administrative overhead (fewer small accounts)
  3. Increase average member stake
  4. Not affect existing members (grandfathered in)

Expected Impact:
  - New members must deposit 100+ MUSD
  - Existing members not affected
  - May slow growth but improve quality

Voting Period: 7 days
Required Approval: 60%
Quorum: 51%
```

### 5. Change Strategy Proposal

**When to use:** Modify yield generation approach

```yaml
Proposal Type: Change Yield Strategy
Title: "Reallocate 20% to Higher-Yield DeFi Protocols"

Current Strategy:
  - Mezo Staking: 50% (8-12% APY)
  - DeFi Lending: 30% (15-20% APY)
  - Liquidity Pools: 20% (20-30% APY)

Proposed Strategy:
  - Mezo Staking: 40% (-10%)
  - DeFi Lending: 30% (no change)
  - Liquidity Pools: 30% (+10%)

Rationale: |
  Recent market analysis shows LP yields stable at 25%.
  Mezo staking yields dropped to 8%.
  Reallocation could increase pool APY from 14% to 16%.

Risk Assessment:
  - Mezo staking: Very Low Risk
  - Liquidity Pools: Low-Medium Risk
  - Increased risk: Minimal
  - Potential reward: +2% APY = +2,500 MUSD/year

Voting Period: 7 days
Required Approval: 60%
Quorum: 51%
```

### 6. Distribute Yields Proposal

**When to use:** Pay out accumulated yields to members

```yaml
Proposal Type: Distribute Accumulated Yields
Title: "Quarterly Yield Distribution - June 2026"

Details:
  Total Yields Available: 3,450 MUSD
  Distribution Method: Proportional to balance

  Example Distributions:
    Member A (5,000 MUSD balance) → 1,200 MUSD
    Member B (2,500 MUSD balance) → 600 MUSD
    Member C (1,000 MUSD balance) → 240 MUSD
    ... (42 more members)

  Remaining in Pool: 0 MUSD (full distribution)

  Or, Alternative Option:
  - Distribute 80%: 2,760 MUSD
  - Keep 20% in treasury: 690 MUSD

Execution: Within 48 hours of approval
Gas Fees: Covered by pool treasury

Voting Period: 3 days
Required Approval: 51%
Quorum: 40%
```

## Proposal Lifecycle

Understanding what happens after voting:

### 1. Proposal Creation

```
Day 0, 14:00
├─ Member creates proposal
├─ Smart contract validates
├─ Proposal goes live
├─ Members notified
└─ Voting begins immediately
```

### 2. Voting Period

```
Days 0-3 (3-day voting period)
├─ Members review proposal
├─ Discussions happen

├─ Quorum checked
└─ Pass/fail determined
```

### 4. Outcome Determination

```
Proposal Passes IF:
✓ Quorum Met (enough participation)
    AND
✓ Approval Met (enough YES votes)

Example (Democratic, 51% quorum, 60% approval):
├─ Total Members: 45
├─ Votes Cast: 30 (67% participation) ✓ Quorum met (need 51%)
├─ YES Votes: 20 (67% of votes) ✓ Approval met (need 60%)
└─ Result: ✅ PASSED
```

### 5. Execution

```
Passed Proposals:
├─ Queued for execution
├─ Timelock delay (if configured): 24-48 hours
├─ Executed automatically or manually
├─ On-chain event emitted
└─ Members notified

Failed Proposals:
├─ Marked as rejected
├─ No action taken
├─ Can be re-proposed with changes
└─ Members notified
```

**Execution Examples:**

```solidity
// Add Member - Executed Automatically
function executeAddMember(uint256 proposalId) internal {
    Proposal memory proposal = proposals[proposalId];
    address newMember = abi.decode(proposal.data, (address));

    members.push(newMember);
    memberStatus[newMember] = MemberStatus.ACTIVE;

    emit MemberAdded(newMember, block.timestamp);
}

// Distribute Yields - Executed Automatically
function executeDistributeYields(uint256 proposalId) internal {
    uint256 totalYields = accumulatedYields;

    for (uint i = 0; i < members.length; i++) {
        address member = members[i];
        uint256 share = calculateMemberShare(member, totalYields);
        MUSD.transfer(member, share);
    }

    emit YieldsDistributed(totalYields, block.timestamp);
}
```

### 6. Post-Execution

```
After execution:
├─ Results published
├─ Impact measured
├─ Feedback collected
├─ Lessons learned
└─ Documentation updated
```

## Quorum & Approval Thresholds

Understanding these critical concepts:

### Quorum (Minimum Participation)

**What it is:**
Minimum percentage of members who must vote for proposal to be valid.

**Why it matters:**
Prevents small groups from making decisions for entire pool.

**Common Settings:**
```
Low Quorum (30-40%):
├─ Pros: Easier to pass proposals
├─ Cons: Small group can decide
└─ Best for: Large pools, routine decisions

Medium Quorum (51%):
├─ Pros: Balanced participation
├─ Cons: May be hard to reach
└─ Best for: Most pools, most decisions

High Quorum (60-75%):
├─ Pros: Strong mandate
├─ Cons: Very hard to reach
└─ Best for: Critical decisions only
```

**Example:**
```
Pool: 100 members
Quorum: 51%

Scenario A: 60 members vote (60% participation)
├─ Quorum: ✓ Met (60% > 51%)
├─ Proposal: Can pass if approval threshold met

Scenario B: 40 members vote (40% participation)
├─ Quorum: ✗ Not Met (40% < 51%)
├─ Proposal: Fails automatically, regardless of YES/NO ratio
```

### Approval Threshold (YES Vote Requirement)

**What it is:**
Minimum percentage of YES votes (out of votes cast) to pass.

**Common Settings:**
```
Simple Majority (51%):
├─ 51% YES votes needed
├─ Standard for routine decisions
└─ Example: Small treasury expenses

Supermajority (60-67%):
├─ 60-67% YES votes needed
├─ For important decisions
└─ Example: Add/remove members, parameter changes

Supermajority (75-80%):
├─ 75-80% YES votes needed
├─ For critical decisions
└─ Example: Smart contract upgrades, dissolve pool
```

**Example:**
```
Votes Cast: 50
Approval Threshold: 60%

Scenario A:
├─ YES: 32 (64%)
├─ NO: 18 (36%)
└─ Result: ✓ Passes (64% > 60%)

Scenario B:
├─ YES: 28 (56%)
├─ NO: 22 (44%)
└─ Result: ✗ Fails (56% < 60%)
```

### Combined Example

```
Pool Configuration:
├─ Total Members: 45
├─ Quorum: 51%
└─ Approval: 60%

Proposal Results:
├─ Votes Cast: 30 (67% participation)
├─ YES: 20
├─ NO: 10

Check 1: Quorum
├─ 30/45 = 67% participation
├─ Need: 51%
└─ ✓ Met

Check 2: Approval
├─ 20/30 = 67% YES votes
├─ Need: 60%
└─ ✓ Met

Final Result: ✅ PASSED
```

## Governance Strategies

### For Active Participants

   - Comment on proposals
   - Share reasoning
   - Educate others

3. **Create Quality Proposals**
   - Clear title and description
   - Detailed justification
   - Expected impact analysis
   - Supporting data

4. **Build Consensus**
   - Discuss before proposing
   - Gauge member sentiment
   - Address concerns proactively
   - Revise based on feedback

### For Pool Success

**Healthy Governance Indicators:**

```
✅ Good Governance Pool:
├─ 60-80% average voter turnout
├─ 5-10 proposals per month
├─ 70-80% proposal pass rate
├─ Active discussions (comments)
├─ Respectful disagreements
├─ Quick quorum achievement
└─ Diverse proposal creators

⚠️ Warning Signs:
├─ less than 40% average turnout
├─ Same people always proposing
├─ Most proposals fail
├─ No discussion/comments
├─ Voting deadline extensions needed
└─ Member complaints about governance
```

### Improving Participation

**If turnout is low:**

1. **Shorten voting period** (7d → 3d)
2. **Send reminders** (24h before end)
3. **Lower quorum** (if appropriate)
4. **Gamify** (badges for voters)
5. **Make it easier** (better UX)
6. **Explain impact** ("This affects you because...")
7. **Reward voters** (from treasury)

**Example Incentive Program:**
```
Voting Rewards (Quarterly):

Tier 1 - Perfect Voter (100% participation)
└─ Reward: 20 MUSD bonus from treasury

Tier 2 - Active Voter (80-99%)
└─ Reward: 10 MUSD bonus

Tier 3 - Regular Voter (60-79%)
└─ Reward: 5 MUSD bonus

Cost: ~450 MUSD/quarter for 45 members
Benefit: 90%+ participation, better decisions
```

## Advanced Governance Features

### Delegation (Coming Soon)

Delegate your voting power:

```typescript
// Allow trusted member to vote on your behalf
delegate(delegateAddress: "0x742d...");

// Useful when:
// - You're traveling/busy
// - You trust another member's judgment
// - You want to consolidate voting power
// - You're inactive but want to participate

// You can reclaim anytime
undelegate();
```

## Common Governance Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Disputed Proposal

**Situation:** Controversial proposal with community split

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Extended Discussion Period**
   - Pause voting temporarily
   - Host community call/meeting
   - Let both sides present arguments

2. **Mediator Involvement**
   - Neutral third party
   - Facilitates discussion
   - Proposes compromise

3. **Revised Proposal**
   - Address concerns
   - Find middle ground
   - Re-vote on new version

**Example:**
```
Original Proposal: "Increase minimum to 500 MUSD"
├─ Supporters: Want serious, committed members
├─ Opponents: Too exclusive, hurts accessibility
└─ Split: 48% YES, 52% NO

Compromise Proposal: "Increase to 150 MUSD, grandfather existing"
├─ New members: 150 MUSD minimum
├─ Existing members: Keep current balances
└─ Result: 78% YES ✓ Passed
```

### Scenario 2: Low Participation

**Situation:** Only 30% voting, quorum not met

**Actions:**

### Scenario 3: Admin Abuse

**Situation:** Admin creating unfair proposals

**Member Protection:**
1. **Create Counter-Proposal**
   - Any member can propose
   - Vote to remove admin rights
   - Transfer to multi-sig

2. **Emergency Community Vote**
   - Fast-track removal
   - Restore democratic control
   - Document for transparency

3. **Fork the Pool** (last resort)
   - Create new pool
   - Invite members to migrate
   - Leave toxic environment

**Prevention:**
- Use multi-sig admin from start
- Limit admin powers
- Regular admin elections
- Transparent decision-making
