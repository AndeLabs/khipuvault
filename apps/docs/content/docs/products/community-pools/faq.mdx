# Community Pools FAQ

Find answers to the most common questions about community pools, from getting started to advanced governance.

## Getting Started

### What exactly is a community pool?

A community pool is a smart contract-based savings group where multiple people deposit funds together, earn yields collectively, and make decisions democratically through on-chain voting.

Think of it as a **credit union on blockchain** - but better:
- Fully transparent (all transactions on-chain)
- Non-custodial (members control funds, not admins)
- Democratic (vote on all important decisions)
- Automated (smart contracts enforce rules)

### How is this different from Individual Savings?

| Feature | Individual Savings | Community Pools |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Control** | You alone | Shared (voting) |
| **Deposits** | Only you | Multiple members |
| **Withdrawals** | Instant | May require approval |
| **Governance** | Not needed | Democratic voting |
| **Minimum** | 10 MUSD | 50 MUSD |
| **Privacy** | Fully private | Shared with members |
| **Social** | Solo | Community-driven |
| **Yields** | Same APY | Same APY |

**Use Individual if:** You want full control and privacy.

**Use Community if:** You want to save with a group, share governance, and build community.

### Can I use both Individual and Community pools?

**Absolutely!** Many users have:
- Individual pool for personal savings
- Community pool(s) for group projects
- Different strategies for each

There's no limit to how many pools you can be in.

### How do I find pools to join?

1. Go to [khipuvault.com/pools](https://khipuvault.com)
2. Browse by:
   - **Category**: Church, Neighborhood, Sports, Family, etc.
   - **Location**: Country, region, language
   - **Size**: Members, total deposits
   - **Type**: Open, Hybrid, Closed

3. Filter by:
   - Minimum deposit (50-1000 MUSD)
   - Voting type (Democratic, Weighted)
   - APY performance
   - Activity level

[See full guide →](/docs/products/community-pools/joining-pool)

### What's the minimum to join?

Depends on the pool:
- **Typical minimum**: 50-100 MUSD
- **Low-barrier pools**: 25-50 MUSD
- **Investment clubs**: 500-1000+ MUSD

Check each pool's requirements before joining.

### Are there fees?

**Platform Fee**: 10% of yields (standard across KhipuVault)
- Example: Pool earns 100 MUSD → KhipuVault takes 10 MUSD, pool keeps 90 MUSD

**Pool Admin Fee** (optional, if pool configured):
- 0-2% additional fee
- Goes to pool treasury
- Requires governance vote to spend

**Gas Fees** (blockchain):
- Join pool: ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01)
- Vote: ~0.00005 BTC (~$0.005)
- Deposit: ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01)
- Withdraw: ~0.00015 BTC (~$0.015)

**No fees for:**
- Browsing pools
- Viewing pool details
- Discussing proposals

## Membership

### Can anyone join any pool?

Depends on pool type:

**Open Pools**: Yes, anyone can join instantly
- Deposit minimum amount
- Automatically become member
- Start earning and voting immediately

**Hybrid Pools**: Request to join, admin approves
- Submit application
- Wait for approval (24-48 hours)
- If approved, deposit and join

**Closed Pools**: Invite-only
- Need invitation from admin or member
- Can't request to join
- Usually for families, close-knit groups

### What are my responsibilities as a member?

**Governance** (most important):
- ✅ Vote on proposals regularly
- ✅ Read proposals before voting
- ✅ Participate in discussions
- ✅ Create proposals when needed

**Financial**:
- ✅ Maintain minimum balance (if required)
- ✅ Withdraw responsibly (respect limits)
- ✅ Consider pool impact before large withdrawals

**Community**:
- ✅ Engage respectfully
- ✅ Help onboard new members
- ✅ Share knowledge
- ✅ Represent pool positively

**Optional but appreciated**:
- Join pool Discord/Telegram
- Attend virtual meetings
- Contribute ideas
- Help with pool management

### Can I be in multiple pools?

**Yes!** There's no limit. Many users join:
- Multiple pools for diversification
- Different community types (church + neighborhood)
- Various risk levels
- Backup pools

**Diversification Strategy:**
```
Example: Juan's Portfolio
├─ Pool 1: Church Building Fund (1,000 MUSD)
│   └─ Purpose: Community project
├─ Pool 2: Neighborhood Emergency (500 MUSD)
│   └─ Purpose: Safety net
├─ Pool 3: Investment Club (2,000 MUSD)
│   └─ Purpose: Aggressive growth
└─ Total: 3,500 MUSD across 3 pools
```

### Can I leave a pool anytime?

**Usually, yes** - but check pool rules:

**Standard Exit**:
1. Request withdrawal of your balance
2. Wait for processing (usually instant)
3. Choose to stay as zero-balance member OR fully exit
4. No penalty

**With Notice Period** (some pools):
1. Submit leave request
2. Wait notice period (7-30 days)
3. Withdraw funds
4. Membership removed

**Emergency Exit** (always available):
1. Initiate emergency withdrawal
2. Wait 7 days
3. Receive full balance automatically
4. Membership removed

<Callout type="info">
**Your funds are always accessible.** Even if the pool has restrictions, emergency exit guarantees you can always get your money out within 7 days.
</Callout>

### What if I'm inactive for months?

Depends on pool rules:

**Most pools**:
- You remain a member
- Your yields keep accumulating
- You should vote when you return

**Strict pools**:
- Inactivity (no votes for 90+ days) may trigger removal proposal
- You'll be notified before removal
- You can contest or withdraw
- Your funds are safe

**Best practice**: If you'll be away, delegate your vote or communicate with pool admin.

### Can I be kicked out?

**Yes, but only via democratic vote:**

**Valid reasons**:
- Long-term inactivity (90+ days no voting)
- Rule violations
- Malicious behavior
- Fraud or deception

**Protection mechanisms**:
- Requires 60-70% member approval (high threshold)
- 7-day grace period to contest
- You can withdraw funds during voting
- Always keep your balance + yields

**Cannot be removed for**:
- Personal disagreements
- Single missed vote
- Small balance
- Political/religious views

<Callout type="warning">
**Fairness Guarantee**: Even if removed, you ALWAYS get your full balance (principal + yields). Funds cannot be confiscated.
</Callout>

## Governance & Voting

### How does voting work?

Two main systems:

**1. Democratic (One Person, One Vote)**
```
Everyone equal, regardless of deposit size

Example:
├─ Member A (5,000 MUSD): 1 vote
├─ Member B (100 MUSD): 1 vote
└─ Member C (2,000 MUSD): 1 vote
```

**2. Weighted (Vote Power by Deposit)**
```
Voting power proportional to your deposit

Example:
├─ Member A (5,000 MUSD): 5,000 weight
├─ Member B (100 MUSD): 100 weight
└─ Member C (2,000 MUSD): 2,000 weight
```

Check your pool's settings to see which system it uses.

[Full voting guide →](/docs/products/community-pools/governance)

### What can members vote on?

Common proposal types:

- ✅ Add or remove members
- ✅ Withdraw pool funds
- ✅ Change pool parameters (minimums, limits)
- ✅ Change yield strategy
- ✅ Distribute accumulated yields
- ✅ Spend treasury funds
- ✅ Emergency actions
- ✅ Admin elections/changes

**Cannot vote on** (automatic):
- Individual deposits
- Individual withdrawals (within limits)
- Yield calculations
- Platform fees

### What is quorum and why does it matter?

**Quorum** = minimum participation required for a vote to be valid.

**Example:**
```
Pool: 100 members
Quorum: 51%

Scenario A: 60 members vote
├─ Participation: 60%
├─ Quorum: ✓ Met (60% > 51%)
└─ Vote is valid

Scenario B: 40 members vote
├─ Participation: 40%
├─ Quorum: ✗ Not met (40% < 51%)
└─ Vote fails automatically, even if 100% voted YES
```

**Why it matters**: Prevents small groups from making decisions for everyone.

### Can I change my vote?

**No** - votes are final once submitted.

**Why**: Blockchain immutability. Once your vote is on-chain, it cannot be altered.

**Best practice**:
- Read proposals thoroughly
- Ask questions first
- Think before voting
- Don't rush

### What if I disagree with a vote result?

**Options:**

1. **Accept the outcome** (recommended)
   - Democracy means majority rules
   - You won't win every vote
   - Stay and try to influence future votes

2. **Create a new proposal**
   - Propose changes to the decision
   - Rally support for your position
   - Democratic process continues

3. **Leave the pool**
   - Withdraw your funds
   - Exit the pool
   - Find or create a pool that aligns better

**Cannot do**:
- ❌ Overturn vote without new proposal
- ❌ Force admin to ignore vote
- ❌ Fork the pool's smart contract

### How long do votes take?

**Voting period**: Set by pool (typically 3-7 days)

**Execution**: Usually automatic within 24-48 hours after vote ends

**Total timeline**:
```
Day 0: Proposal created
Days 1-3: Voting period
Day 3: Voting closes, results tallied
Day 4: Proposal executed (if passed)
```

**Emergency proposals**: Can be fast-tracked (24-hour voting)

## Financial Questions

### How do yields work in community pools?

**Same as Individual pools**: 12-18% APY

**Distribution**: Proportional to your deposit

```
Example Pool:
├─ Total Deposits: 10,000 MUSD
├─ Monthly Yield: 120 MUSD (14.4% APY)
├─ Platform Fee: -12 MUSD (10%)
├─ Net to Pool: 108 MUSD

Your Share:
├─ Your Deposit: 1,000 MUSD (10% of pool)
├─ Your Yield: 10.8 MUSD (10% of 108)
├─ Your APY: 12.96% (same as pool)
```

**Key point**: Everyone earns the same APY, regardless of when they joined.

### Do larger pools earn more?

**Same APY** - 12-18% whether pool has 10 or 1,000 members.

**But larger pools may have:**
- More stability (less impacted by single withdrawal)
- Better governance (more diverse opinions)
- More features (treasury for events, tools)
- Stronger community

**Smaller pools may have:**
- Tighter community
- Faster decisions
- Less complexity
- More personal

### What happens to yields?

Three options (pool decides):

**1. Auto-Compound (Most Common)**
- Yields added to your balance automatically
- Earns yields on yields (compounding)
- Maximizes growth
- No action needed

**2. Distribute Periodically**
- Yields paid out quarterly/annually
- Actual MUSD sent to your wallet
- Requires governance vote
- Costs gas for distributions

**3. Pool Treasury**
- Yields stay in pool
- Used for pool expenses/projects
- Requires vote to distribute
- Transparent tracking

### Can I withdraw anytime?

**Small withdrawals**: Usually instant
- Up to 10% of your balance
- No approval needed
- Just gas fees

**Large withdrawals**: May require approval
- greater than 10% of your balance OR
- greater than 10% of total pool
- Requires governance vote
- Protects pool stability

**Emergency withdrawal**: Always available
- Full balance
- 7-day waiting period
- No vote needed
- Removes you from pool

<Callout type="success">
**Liquidity Guarantee**: You can always access your funds, even if it takes up to 7 days in extreme cases.
</Callout>

### What if the pool runs out of money?

**Won't happen** because:

1. **Your balance is yours**
   - Pool tracks individual balances
   - Not a shared pot
   - Your deposit + yields = guaranteed

2. **Withdrawal limits**
   - Daily caps prevent bank runs
   - Large withdrawals need approval
   - Emergency withdrawal has delay

3. **Liquidity management**
   - YieldAggregator maintains liquidity
   - Not all funds locked in strategies
   - Can recall funds if needed

**Worst case**: 7-day delay for emergency withdrawal. But you'll get every MUSD you're owed.

### Are my funds FDIC insured?

**No** - this is crypto, not a traditional bank.

**Protection instead:**
- Smart contract security (audited)
- Non-custodial (you control)
- On-chain transparency (verifiable)
- Emergency withdrawal rights (guaranteed)

**Risks:**
- Smart contract bugs (minimized via audits)
- Blockchain issues (very unlikely on Mezo)
- Yield strategy risks (diversified)

**Not risks:**
- Pool admin stealing (impossible)
- Bank failure (no bank involved)
- Government seizure (decentralized)

## Security & Privacy

### Is my money safe?

**Security layers:**

1. **Smart Contract Audits**
   - Audited by CertiK
   - Reviewed by Mezo team
   - 95%+ test coverage
   - Battle-tested for 6+ months

2. **Non-Custodial**
   - Only you can withdraw your funds
   - Admin cannot access member balances
   - Smart contract enforces ownership

3. **On-Chain Transparency**
   - All transactions visible
   - Can verify balances anytime
   - Immutable record

4. **Multi-Sig Admin** (recommended)
   - Requires 3-of-5 signatures
   - No single point of failure
   - Community-controlled

**Realistic risks**:
- Smart contract bug (very low, audited)
- Yield strategy underperforms (market risk)
- Your private key compromised (your responsibility)

[Full security details →](/docs/security)

### Can other members see my balance?

**In community pools: Yes**

Members can see:
- ✅ Your deposit amount
- ✅ Your yields earned
- ✅ Your voting history
- ✅ Your wallet address
- ✅ Your proposals created

Members **cannot** see:
- ❌ Your other wallets
- ❌ Your transactions outside pool
- ❌ Your real identity (unless you share)

**Privacy options**:
- Use pseudonymous wallet
- Don't link to real identity
- Create privacy-focused pools

**Why transparent**: Trust and accountability. Members need to know pool is fair.

### What if I lose my private key?

**Unfortunately**: Your funds are **permanently lost**.

**Smart contracts cannot:**
- Reset passwords
- Recover keys
- Transfer without signature

**Prevention**:
- 📝 Write down seed phrase (physical paper)
- 🔐 Use hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor)
- 💾 Store backups securely (safe, bank vault)
- 🚫 Never share with anyone
- 🤔 Consider multi-sig for large amounts

**NEVER**:
- Store in cloud (iCloud, Google Drive)
- Store in email
- Screenshot seed phrase
- Share with "support" (scam)

### Can the pool admin steal my money?

**No** - impossible due to smart contract rules.

**Admin can**:
- ✅ Approve join requests (Hybrid pools)
- ✅ Create proposals
- ✅ Pause pool (emergencies only)
- ✅ Update metadata (name, description)

**Admin CANNOT**:
- ❌ Withdraw your funds
- ❌ Transfer your balance
- ❌ Block your withdrawals
- ❌ Change votes
- ❌ Bypass governance

**Code is law**: Smart contract enforces rules. Even malicious admin cannot steal.

<Callout type="success">
**Trust the Code, Not the Admin**: That's the beauty of smart contracts. Admin powers are strictly limited by code.
</Callout>
