# Individual Savings Pools

Create your own personal savings pool with full control, privacy, and steady yields.

## What is Individual Savings?

Individual Savings is the simplest product on KhipuVault. You create a personal pool, deposit MUSD, and earn yields automatically. Think of it as a high-yield savings account on blockchain.

**Key Features:**
- 🏦 **Personal pool** - Only you control it
- 📈 **Steady yields** - 12-18% APY
- ⚡ **Flexible** - Deposit and withdraw anytime
- 🔒 **Private** - Your balance is your business
- 🎯 **Goal-oriented** - Set savings targets

## How It Works

```
You → Create Pool → Deposit MUSD → Earn Yields → Withdraw Anytime
```

1. **Create your pool** - One-time smart contract deployment
2. **Deposit MUSD** - Add funds whenever you want
3. **Yields accumulate** - Every block (~5 seconds)
4. **Withdraw freely** - No penalties, no lock-ups

## Current Returns

<Callout type="success">
**Current APY**: 12-18% (varies by market conditions)

**Platform Fee**: 10% of yields (you keep 90%)

**Example**: Deposit 1,000 MUSD → Earn ~162 MUSD/year (after fees)
