# Yields & Rewards

Learn how your MUSD earns returns in Individual Savings pools and maximize your passive income.

## How Yields Are Generated

Your deposits earn from multiple sources simultaneously, creating a diversified yield stream.

### Yield Sources Breakdown

When you deposit MUSD, it's automatically allocated across:

| Source | Allocation | APY Range | Risk Level |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| DeFi Lending | 50% | 8-12% | Low |
| Mezo Staking | 30% | 4-8% | Very Low |
| Liquidity Pools | 20% | 2-5% | Low |
| **Combined** | **100%** | **12-18%** | **Low** |

<Callout type="info">
These allocations are dynamic and adjusted by the YieldAggregator contract based on market conditions to maximize your returns while maintaining safety.
</Callout>

### Source 1: DeFi Lending

**How it works:**

Your MUSD is lent to borrowers on decentralized lending protocols:

```
Your MUSD → Aave/Compound → Borrowers
Borrowers pay interest → Protocol collects → You earn
```

**Example protocols:**
- **Aave** - Leading lending protocol
- **Compound** - Algorithmic money market
- **Mezo Lend** - Native Mezo lending

**Current rates:** 8-12% APY

**Why it's safe:**
- All loans are over-collateralized (150-200%)
- If borrower defaults, collateral is liquidated
- Your principal is protected by protocol insurance

<Callout type="success">
**Example:** You deposit 1,000 MUSD. 50% (500 MUSD) goes to lending. At 10% APY, you earn 50 MUSD/year from this source alone.
</Callout>

### Source 2: Mezo Staking

**How it works:**

MUSD is converted to BTC and staked with Mezo validators:

```
MUSD → Swap to BTC → Stake with validators → Earn rewards
Validators earn block rewards → Shared with stakers → You earn
```

**Current rates:** 4-8% APY

**Why it's safe:**
- Native blockchain staking (most secure)
- No smart contract risk on this portion
- Instant unstaking if needed

**Validator selection:**
KhipuVault delegates to top-performing validators with:
- ✅ 99.9%+ uptime
- ✅ Established reputation
- ✅ Transparent commission (5-10%)

### Source 3: Liquidity Provision

**How it works:**

MUSD is paired with other stablecoins in AMM pools:

```
MUSD + USDC → Uniswap/Curve Pool → Traders pay fees → You earn
```

**Current rates:** 2-5% APY

**Why it's safe:**
- Stablecoin-only pairs (minimal impermanent loss)
- High-volume pools (reliable fees)
- Automated position management

**Typical pairs:**
- MUSD-USDC (most stable)
- MUSD-DAI
- MUSD-USDT

<Callout type="warning">
**Impermanent Loss:** With stablecoin pairs, this is negligible (< 0.1%). If MUSD deviates from $1.00, the YieldAggregator automatically rebalances to protect you.
</Callout>

## APY Calculation

Understanding your Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

### Base APY Formula

```
APY = ((1 + Daily Rate)^365 - 1) × 100
```

**Current Individual Savings APY:** 12-18%

**Example (15% APY):**
```
Daily Rate = 0.15 / 365 = 0.04109%
Per 1,000 MUSD = 1,000 × 0.0004109 = 0.41 MUSD/day
```

### APY vs APR

Important distinction:

| Metric | Definition | Individual Savings |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **APR** | Annual Percentage Rate (simple interest) | ~14.5% |
| **APY** | Annual Percentage Yield (compounded) | ~15.5% |

**Why APY is higher:**
Yields compound every block (~5 seconds), so you earn interest on interest.

```
APR: 1,000 MUSD → 1,145 MUSD (simple)
APY: 1,000 MUSD → 1,155 MUSD (compounded)
Difference: +10 MUSD (0.7% more)
```

<Callout type="success">
KhipuVault displays APY (the higher number) because that's what you actually earn. Some platforms show APR to look competitive but pay less!
</Callout>

### Variable vs Fixed APY

Individual Savings APY is **variable** (changes with market conditions):

**Factors affecting APY:**

1. **DeFi market demand**
   - More borrowers = higher rates
   - Less liquidity = higher rates
   - Bear market = lower rates

2. **Mezo network staking rewards**
   - More validators = lower rewards
   - Higher network usage = higher fees
   - BTC price increase = higher dollar value

3. **Trading volume**
   - High DEX volume = more fees
   - New token launches = fee spikes
   - Market volatility = more trading

**Historical range (last 6 months):**
```
Lowest: 11.2% APY (June 2025)
Highest: 19.4% APY (December 2025)
Average: 15.1% APY
Current: 15.0% APY
```

**APY update frequency:**
- Recalculated every 4 hours
- Displayed in real-time on dashboard
- Historical APY chart available

## Compounding Explained

Your secret weapon for wealth building.

### How Compounding Works

Traditional banks compound daily/monthly. KhipuVault compounds **every block** (~5 seconds):

```
Block 1: 1,000.000 MUSD
Block 2: 1,000.001 MUSD (yield added to principal)
Block 3: 1,000.002 MUSD (compound on 1,000.001)
Block 4: 1,000.003 MUSD (compound on 1,000.002)
...
```

### Continuous Compounding Math

```
Final Amount = Principal × e^(rate × time)
```

**Example (1 year at 15% APY):**
```
No compounding: 1,000 × 1.15 = 1,150 MUSD
Daily compounding: 1,000 × (1 + 0.15/365)^365 = 1,161.83 MUSD
Continuous (block-level): 1,000 × e^0.15 = 1,161.83 MUSD

Extra earnings from compounding: 11.83 MUSD (1.0%)
```

### Compounding Over Time

The longer you hold, the more powerful compounding becomes:

| Period | 15% APY (No Compound) | 15% APY (Continuous) | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 year | 1,150 MUSD | 1,161.83 MUSD | +11.83 |
| 3 years | 1,450 MUSD | 1,568.31 MUSD | +118.31 |
| 5 years | 1,750 MUSD | 2,117.00 MUSD | +367.00 |
| 10 years | 2,500 MUSD | 4,481.69 MUSD | +1,981.69 |

**Starting with 1,000 MUSD:**

<Callout type="success" title="The Power of Compounding">
After 10 years:
- Without compounding: +1,500 MUSD (150%)
- With compounding: +3,481.69 MUSD (348%)
- Compounding adds: +1,981.69 MUSD extra (132% more!)

**Conclusion:** Never withdraw unless absolutely necessary. Compounding is free money!
</Callout>

### Manual vs Auto-Compounding

Some platforms require you to "claim" yields. Not KhipuVault:

| Feature | KhipuVault | Traditional DeFi |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Claiming | Automatic | Manual (costs gas) |
| Frequency | Every block (~5s) | Daily/weekly |
| Gas costs | $0 (built-in) | $0.50-$2 per claim |
| Optimal? | Always | Only if yields > gas |

**Why auto-compound is better:**

If you had to claim manually:
```
Yields earned per day: 0.41 MUSD
Gas cost per claim: $0.01
Weekly yields: 2.87 MUSD
Weekly gas: $0.07 (claiming 7x)
Annual gas: $3.65 (claiming 365x)

With auto-compound: $0 gas, higher yields
```

## Platform Fees

Transparency in our fee structure.

### Fee Breakdown

KhipuVault charges a **performance fee** only:

| Fee Type | Rate | When Charged | You Pay |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| Management | 0% | Never | $0 |
| Deposit | 0% | Never | $0 |
| Withdrawal | 0% | Never | $0 |
| Performance | 10% | On yields earned | 10% of yields |

<Callout type="info">
**Simple rule:** We only make money when you make money. If yields are $100, we take $10, you keep $90.
</Callout>

### Performance Fee Example

Let's calculate your actual earnings:

```
Deposit: 10,000 MUSD
Time: 1 year
Gross APY: 16.67% (before fees)
Gross Yields: 1,667 MUSD

Platform Fee: 1,667 × 10% = 166.7 MUSD
Your Net Yields: 1,667 - 166.7 = 1,500.3 MUSD
Your Net APY: 15% (after fees)
```

**What you see in dashboard:**
```
Displayed APY: 15% (already net of fees)
Gross yields: Hidden (you don't need to calculate)
Net yields: Shown (what you actually earn)
```

### Fee Comparison Table

How KhipuVault stacks up:

| Platform | Management | Performance | Net APY | Total Cost |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **KhipuVault** | 0% | 10% | ~15% | 10% of yields |
| Yearn Finance | 2% | 20% | ~12% | 2% + 20% of yields |
| Traditional Bank | 0% | 0% | ~0.5% | Spread (hidden) |
| DeFi Aggregator | 1-3% | 15-20% | ~10% | 3-5% total |
| Hedge Fund | 2% | 20% | ~8% | 4-6% total |

<Callout type="success">
**KhipuVault is the most transparent:** You always know exactly what you're paying (10% of yields). No hidden fees, no spread, no surprises.
</Callout>

### Fee Distribution

Where does the 10% go?

```
Platform Fee (10% of yields) =
  50% → Protocol treasury (development, audits)
  30% → Yield strategy optimization (better returns for you)
  20% → Team compensation
```

**Alignment of incentives:**
- Higher yields for you = higher fees for us
- We're motivated to maximize your returns
- Win-win relationship

## Yield Optimization

How KhipuVault maximizes your returns.

### Dynamic Allocation

The YieldAggregator contract continuously monitors and reallocates:

```
Every 4 hours:
1. Check APY of each yield source
2. Calculate optimal allocation
3. Rebalance if improvement > 0.5%
4. Update user yields
```

**Example rebalancing:**
```
Before:
  Lending: 50% @ 10% APY = 5.0% contribution
  Staking: 30% @ 6% APY = 1.8% contribution
  LP: 20% @ 4% APY = 0.8% contribution
  Total: 7.6% weighted APY

Lending APY spikes to 14%:
  Lending: 65% @ 14% APY = 9.1% contribution
  Staking: 25% @ 6% APY = 1.5% contribution
  LP: 10% @ 4% APY = 0.4% contribution
  Total: 11.0% weighted APY (+3.4%)
```

You don't do anything - it's automatic!

### Risk Management

Safety features protecting your yields:

**Smart Contract Limits:**
- Max 40% in any single protocol
- Max 60% in any single yield type
- Min 10% in ultra-safe staking

**Circuit Breakers:**

- Covers smart contract exploits
- Covers oracle failures
- Costs built into platform fee

### Yield Boosters

Ways to earn extra:

**Referral Bonuses:**
```
Refer a friend → They deposit → You earn 1% of their yields (forever)
Example: Friend deposits 10,000 MUSD
  Their yearly yields: 1,500 MUSD
  Your bonus: 15 MUSD/year
  Your friend still gets full yields (we pay the bonus)
```

**Loyalty Multiplier:**
```
Hold for 30 days: 1.0× yields (normal)
Hold for 90 days: 1.05× yields (+5%)
Hold for 180 days: 1.10× yields (+10%)
Hold for 365 days: 1.15× yields (+15%)
```

**Large Deposit Bonus:**
```
< 10,000 MUSD: 1.0× APY (normal)
10,000 - 50,000 MUSD: 1.02× APY (+0.3% APY)
50,000 - 100,000 MUSD: 1.05× APY (+0.75% APY)
> 100,000 MUSD: Custom (contact us)
```

<Callout type="success">
**Stack bonuses:** Loyalty + Large Deposit + Referral = Maximum yields!

Example: 50,000 MUSD held 1 year + 3 referrals
  Base APY: 15%
  Loyalty bonus: +15% = 17.25% APY
  Large deposit bonus: +0.75% = 18.0% APY
  Referral yields: +45 MUSD/year extra
</Callout>

## Understanding Yield Fluctuations

Why APY changes and what it means.

### Normal Fluctuations

APY varies daily/weekly - this is expected:

```
Week 1: 15.2% APY
Week 2: 14.8% APY (-0.4%)
Week 3: 15.5% APY (+0.7%)
Week 4: 15.1% APY (-0.4%)

Average: 15.15% APY
Volatility: ±0.5% (low)
```

**This is normal** because:
- DeFi rates change with demand
- Staking rewards vary by validator participation
- LP fees fluctuate with trading volume

### When to Worry

Significant drops (greater than 3%) may indicate:

❌ **Market-wide DeFi decline**
- Solution: Wait it out (usually temporary)
- Check DeFi Pulse for overall market rates

❌ **Protocol issue**
- Solution: YieldAggregator auto-withdraws
- Funds reallocated to safer protocols

❌ **Network congestion**
- Solution: Higher gas = lower net yields temporarily
- Clears within hours

<Callout type="info">
**KhipuVault monitors 24/7:** If APY drops greater than 5% for greater than 24 hours, you'll receive an email alert with explanation and action plan.
</Callout>

### Positive Spikes

Sometimes APY jumps (good for you!):

✅ **New DeFi incentives launched**
- Protocols offer token rewards
- We claim and sell for MUSD
- Extra yields passed to you

✅ **Market volatility increases**
- More trading = more LP fees
- Temporary boost (enjoy it!)

✅ **BTC price increase**
- Staking rewards worth more in USD
- Your balance grows faster
