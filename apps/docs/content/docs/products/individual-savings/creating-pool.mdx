- ✅ Small amount of BTC for gas (~0.0005 BTC)

Not ready? Complete these guides first:
- [Connect Your Wallet](/docs/getting-started/connect-wallet)
- [Add Mezo Network](/docs/getting-started/add-mezo-network)
- [Get MUSD](/docs/getting-started/get-musd)

## Pool Creation Process

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Navigate to Individual Savings

1. Go to [khipuvault.com](https://khipuvault.com)
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** (top right)
3. Select **MetaMask** from the modal
4. Approve the connection request
5. Click **"Products"** in navigation
6. Select **"Individual Savings"**

<Callout type="info">
First-time visitors will see a welcome modal explaining Individual Savings. Click "Get Started" to proceed.
</Callout>

### Open Pool Creation Form

On the Individual Savings page:

1. Click the **"Create New Pool"** button (center of screen)
2. A modal will appear with the pool creation form

You should see:
- Pool Name field
- Goal Amount field (optional)
- Pool Description field (optional)
- Estimated gas fee display
- "Create Pool" button

### Fill in Pool Details

**Pool Name** (required)
- What to enter: A memorable name for your pool
- Examples: "Emergency Fund", "House Down Payment", "Europe Trip 2026"
- Max length: 50 characters
- Can't be changed later (choose wisely!)

```
Good names: "Bitcoin Savings 2026", "My First Pool", "Retirement Fund"
Bad names: "Pool", "123", "asdfsadf"
```

**Goal Amount** (optional)
- What to enter: Your savings target in MUSD
- Examples: 1000, 5000, 10000
- Purpose: Visual progress tracking in dashboard
- Can be updated later

<Callout type="success">
**Tip:** Set a specific goal! Users with goals save 34% more on average. Make it SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
</Callout>

**Pool Description** (optional)
- What to enter: Why you're saving, motivation, notes
- Max length: 200 characters
- Examples: "Saving for a new car by December 2026"
- Only visible to you (private)

**Example Configuration:**
```
Pool Name: "House Down Payment"
Goal Amount: 50000 MUSD
Description: "Saving $50k for a house in Miami by June 2027"
```

### Review Gas Estimate

Before creating, check the estimated gas fee:

```
Estimated Gas: ~0.0002 BTC (~$0.02 USD)
```

This covers:
- Smart contract deployment (your pool instance)
- Storage on blockchain (name, goal, metadata)
- Event emission (PoolCreated)

<Callout type="warning">
Gas fees vary by network congestion. During peak times, fees may be 2-3x higher. If the fee seems too high, wait 10-15 minutes and try again.
</Callout>

### Click "Create Pool"

Hit the **"Create Pool"** button. MetaMask will pop up with a transaction confirmation.

### Approve in MetaMask (Transaction 1)

MetaMask shows:

```
Contract Interaction
To: IndividualPool Contract (0xdfBE...0393)
Data: createPool(...)
Estimated Gas: 0.0002 BTC
```

**What to check:**
- ✅ Network is "Mezo Testnet"
- ✅ Gas fee is reasonable (~0.0002 BTC)
- ✅ Contract address matches: `0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393`

**Click "Confirm"** to proceed.

<Callout type="danger" title="Security Check">
Never approve transactions to unknown contracts! Always verify the contract address matches the official KhipuVault contracts listed in our [documentation](/docs/developers/smart-contracts).
</Callout>

### Wait for Confirmation

You'll see a loading state:

```
Creating your pool...
Transaction submitted: 0x1234...abcd
Waiting for confirmation (usually 5-10 seconds)
```

**What's happening:**
1. Transaction is broadcast to Mezo network
2. Validators pick it up and include it in a block
3. Your pool contract is deployed
4. PoolCreated event is emitted
5. Your pool address is registered

**Typical timeline:** 5-15 seconds

<Callout type="info">
You can check transaction status on [Mezo Block Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org) by pasting your transaction hash.
</Callout>

### Success Confirmation

When complete, you'll see:

```
🎉 Pool Created Successfully!

Your Pool Address: 0x7890...def1
Pool Name: House Down Payment
Goal: 50,000 MUSD
Status: Active

[View on Explorer] [Go to Dashboard]
```

**Save your pool address!** While it's saved automatically in the app, it's good practice to record it.

</div>

<Callout type="success" title="Congratulations!">
You now own a personal savings pool on the blockchain! Your pool is a smart contract that only you control.
</Callout>

## What Just Happened?

Let's break down what occurred on-chain:

### Smart Contract Deployment

```solidity
// A new contract was deployed just for you:
IndividualPoolInstance deployed at: 0x7890...def1

Constructor called with:
- owner: YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
- name: "House Down Payment"
- goalAmount: 50000000000000000000000 (50k MUSD in wei)
```

### Blockchain Event

```solidity
event PoolCreated(
    address indexed owner,
    address indexed poolAddress,
    string name,
    uint256 goalAmount,
    uint256 timestamp
);
```

This event is permanent and can be queried anytime to prove you created this pool.

### Storage Allocated

Your pool contract now stores:
- Owner address (you)
- Pool name ("House Down Payment")
- Goal amount (50,000 MUSD)
- Creation timestamp
- Initial balance (0 MUSD)

## Next Steps After Creation

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### View Your Dashboard

Click **"Go to Dashboard"** to see your new pool:

```
📊 My Pools

House Down Payment
Created: 2 minutes ago
Balance: 0 MUSD
Progress: 0% of 50,000 MUSD goal
Status: Active (ready for deposits)

[Deposit] [Settings]
```

### Make Your First Deposit

Ready to fund your pool? You have two options:

**Option A: Immediate Deposit**
1. Click **"Deposit"** button on your pool
2. Enter amount (minimum 10 MUSD)
3. Approve MUSD spending (one-time)
4. Confirm deposit transaction

[Full deposit guide →](/docs/products/individual-savings/deposits-withdrawals)

**Option B: Wait and Plan**
1. Set up recurring deposits (optional)
2. Calculate your DCA strategy
3. Fund when ready

### Configure Pool Settings (Optional)

Click the gear icon to access settings:

- **Update Goal:** Change your target amount
- **Edit Description:** Update your motivation
- **Enable Notifications:** Get alerts for milestones
- **Privacy Settings:** Show/hide pool on leaderboard

</div>

## Understanding Your Pool Contract

Your pool is now a live smart contract on Mezo blockchain. Here's what you can do with it:

### Owner Privileges

As the owner, you can:
- ✅ Deposit MUSD anytime
- ✅ Withdraw funds anytime (principal + yields)
- ✅ Update pool metadata (name, goal, description)
- ✅ Emergency withdraw (if paused)
- ✅ View detailed analytics

**No one else can:**
- ❌ Deposit to your pool
- ❌ Withdraw your funds
- ❌ Modify your settings
- ❌ Access your balance

### Verifying Your Pool

To verify your pool on-chain:

1. Go to [Mezo Block Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
2. Paste your pool address: `0x7890...def1`
3. You should see:
   - Contract creation transaction
   - Your wallet as deployer
   - Contract code (verified)
   - Zero transactions (until first deposit)

### Reading Pool Data

You can query your pool directly:

```typescript
// Using ethers.js
const pool = new ethers.Contract(poolAddress, poolABI, provider);

// Get pool info
const name = await pool.name(); // "House Down Payment"
const goal = await pool.goalAmount(); // 50000000000000000000000
const balance = await pool.balanceOf(yourAddress); // 0 (no deposits yet)
const owner = await pool.owner(); // YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

## Pool Creation Costs

Here's the full cost breakdown:

| Item | Cost (BTC) | Cost (USD) | When Charged |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Pool Creation | ~0.0002 | ~$0.02 | One-time (now) |
| MUSD Approval | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | Before first deposit |
| First Deposit | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | When depositing |
| **Total** | ~0.0004 | ~$0.04 | To get started |

<Callout type="success">
**Future savings:** After initial setup, deposits cost only ~0.0001 BTC (~$0.01). Much cheaper than bank wire fees ($20-30)!
</Callout>

## Multiple Pools

Can you create more pools? **Absolutely!**

### Why Have Multiple Pools?

Users often create separate pools for:
- 🎯 Different goals (emergency fund, vacation, house)
- 📊 Different strategies (aggressive, conservative)
- 📅 Different timeframes (short-term, long-term)
- 🔒 Different risk profiles

**Example Multi-Pool Strategy:**
```
Pool 1: "Emergency Fund" (Goal: $10k, conservative)
Pool 2: "House Down Payment" (Goal: $50k, moderate)
Pool 3: "Retirement" (Goal: $100k, aggressive)
```

### Creating Additional Pools

Same process:
1. Go to Individual Savings page
2. Click "Create New Pool" again
3. Fill in details for new pool
4. Each pool costs ~0.0002 BTC to create

<Callout type="info">
**Best Practice:** Start with one pool to learn the platform. Add more pools as your strategy evolves. Most users have 2-3 pools.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Failed

**Error:** "Transaction failed"

**Possible causes:**
1. Insufficient BTC for gas → Get more from [faucet](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)
2. Wrong network → Switch to Mezo Testnet
3. Network congestion → Wait 5 minutes and retry
4. MetaMask nonce issue → Reset account (Settings → Advanced → Reset)

### Pool Name Already Taken

**Error:** "Pool name already exists"

**Solution:** Pool names must be unique per user. Try:
- Adding a date: "My Pool 2026"
- Adding a number: "My Pool v2"
- Being more specific: "Emergency Fund - Q1"

### MetaMask Not Popping Up

**Issue:** Clicked "Create Pool" but no MetaMask window

**Solutions:**
1. Check for MetaMask icon in browser extensions (click it manually)
2. Disable pop-up blockers for khipuvault.com
3. Refresh page and try again
4. Restart browser

### Gas Estimate Shows "Error"

**Issue:** Can't estimate gas fee

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're on Mezo Testnet (not Ethereum)
2. Check you have some BTC for gas
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Pool Created But Not Showing

**Issue:** Transaction succeeded but pool not in dashboard

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page (may take 10-20 seconds to index)
2. Check transaction on [Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
3. Verify you're connected with the same wallet that created it
4. Clear browser cache

<Callout type="warning">
If your pool still doesn't show after 5 minutes but the transaction succeeded, contact support with your transaction hash.
</Callout>

## Advanced Options

### Setting a Custom Goal Strategy

Instead of a single goal, some users track multiple metrics:

**Option A: Percentage-Based**
- Goal: Grow balance by 20% each quarter
- Requires manual tracking (calculate externally)

**Option B: Time-Based**
- Goal: Save $500/month for 24 months = $12k total
- Set goal to 12,000 MUSD

**Option C: Yield-Based**
- Goal: Earn $1,000 in yields (not principal)
- Track yields separately in dashboard

### Naming Conventions for Organization

If you plan to have many pools:

```
Format: [Category] - [Purpose] - [Timeline]

Examples:
- "Emergency - Medical - 2026"
- "Savings - House - 5yr"
- "Investment - Crypto - Longterm"
```

Benefits:
- Easy sorting
- Clear purpose
- Better tracking

## Best Practices

<Callout type="success" title="Pool Creation Tips">
✅ **DO:**
- Choose a meaningful, memorable name
- Set a realistic goal (achievable in 6-24 months)
- Write a description to stay motivated
- Verify gas fees before confirming
- Save your pool address

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use generic names ("Pool 1", "Test")
- Set impossibly high goals (demoralizing)
- Skip the description (helps with discipline)
- Create pools you won't use (costs gas)
- Share pool address publicly (privacy)
