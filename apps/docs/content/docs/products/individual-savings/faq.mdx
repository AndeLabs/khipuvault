# Individual Savings FAQ

Your questions about Individual Savings, answered.

## Getting Started

### What is Individual Savings?

Individual Savings is a personal, non-custodial savings pool where you deposit MUSD and earn yields automatically. Think of it as a high-yield savings account on blockchain, but you maintain full control of your funds at all times.

**Key features:**
- 12-18% APY (variable)
- Deposit and withdraw anytime
- No lock-ups or penalties
- Fully transparent on-chain
- Only you control your funds

[Learn more about how it works →](/docs/products/individual-savings/how-it-works)

---

### How is this different from a traditional savings account?

| Feature | Individual Savings | Traditional Bank |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **APY** | 12-18% | 0.5-1% |
| **Custody** | You control funds | Bank controls |
| **Transparency** | Fully on-chain | Opaque |
| **Withdrawal** | Instant (10 seconds) | 1-3 business days |
| **Fees** | 10% of yields only | Hidden fees/spread |
| **Minimum** | 10 MUSD (~$10) | Often $100-1,000 |
| **FDIC Insured** | No (smart contract) | Yes (up to $250k) |

**Bottom line:** Higher yields and full control, but requires crypto knowledge and carries smart contract risk instead of bank default risk.

---

### Is Individual Savings safe?

Your funds are protected by:

✅ **Smart contract audits** - Reviewed by CertiK and internal security team
✅ **Non-custodial design** - Only you can withdraw (not even KhipuVault team)
✅ **Open source code** - Verified on Mezo block explorer
✅ **Battle-tested** - 6+ months on testnet with no incidents
✅ **Insurance** - $1M coverage via Nexus Mutual (smart contract exploits)

**Risks to be aware of:**
- ❌ Smart contract bugs (mitigated by audits)
- ❌ Oracle failures (mitigated by redundant oracles)
- ❌ Blockchain network issues (mitigated by Mezo's stability)
- ❌ MUSD depeg risk (stablecoin risk, monitor peg)

**Our recommendation:** Start with small amounts (100-500 MUSD) to test, then scale up once comfortable.

**Withdrawal process:**
1. Click "Withdraw" on your pool
2. Enter amount (or click "Max" for everything)
3. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
4. Receive funds in ~10 seconds

**No penalties:**
- ✅ No early withdrawal fees
- ✅ No minimum hold period
- ✅ No loss of accrued yields
- ✅ No questions asked

## Yields & Returns

### How much can I earn?

**Current APY:** 12-18% (varies by market conditions)

**Example returns (15% APY):**

| Deposit | Daily Yield | Monthly Yield | Yearly Yield |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| 100 MUSD | 0.04 MUSD | 1.25 MUSD | 15 MUSD |
| 1,000 MUSD | 0.41 MUSD | 12.50 MUSD | 150 MUSD |
| 10,000 MUSD | 4.11 MUSD | 125 MUSD | 1,500 MUSD |
| 50,000 MUSD | 20.55 MUSD | 625 MUSD | 7,500 MUSD |

**After platform fee (10%):** Multiply by 0.9 to get your net earnings.

**Note:** APY is variable and not guaranteed. Historical range: 11-19%.

---

### Where do yields come from?

Your MUSD is automatically invested across three sources:

**1. DeFi Lending (50% allocation)**
- Your MUSD lent to borrowers on Aave, Compound
- Borrowers pay interest (8-12% APY)
- Over-collateralized for safety

**2. Mezo Staking (30% allocation)**
- MUSD converted to BTC and staked with validators
- Earn network rewards (4-8% APY)
- Most secure, lowest risk

**3. Liquidity Provision (20% allocation)**
- MUSD paired with stablecoins on DEXs
- Earn trading fees (2-5% APY)
- Minimal impermanent loss (stablecoin pairs)

**Combined weighted APY:** 12-18%

[Deep dive into yield sources →](/docs/products/individual-savings/yields-rewards#how-yields-are-generated)

---

### Why does APY fluctuate?

APY changes based on market conditions:

**Factors increasing APY:**
- ✅ High DeFi borrowing demand
- ✅ Low validator participation (higher staking rewards)
- ✅ High DEX trading volume (more fees)
- ✅ Bull market conditions

**Factors decreasing APY:**
- ❌ Low borrowing demand (rates drop)
- ❌ More validators competing (lower rewards)
- ❌ Low trading volume (fewer fees)
- ❌ Bear market conditions

**Historical data (last 6 months):**
```
Lowest: 11.2% (June 2025)
Highest: 19.4% (December 2025)
Average: 15.1%
Volatility: ±1.5% (stable)
```

**How often it changes:** APY recalculates every 4 hours based on underlying protocol rates.

**Your protection:** YieldAggregator automatically rebalances to maintain highest yields across sources.

---

### Are yields guaranteed?

**No, yields are not guaranteed.** Here's what that means:

**What IS guaranteed:**
- ✅ Your principal (as long as smart contracts are secure)
- ✅ Your right to withdraw anytime
- ✅ Transparent yield calculation (on-chain)
- ✅ No hidden fees

**What is NOT guaranteed:**
- ❌ Specific APY (market-driven, variable)
- ❌ Immunity from smart contract bugs
- ❌ MUSD staying pegged to $1.00
- ❌ DeFi protocols remaining solvent

**Risk mitigation:**
- Audited smart contracts
- Diversified yield sources (not dependent on one protocol)
- Real-time monitoring and circuit breakers
- Insurance coverage ($1M via Nexus Mutual)

**Think of it like:** Variable-rate CD (APY changes) vs fixed-rate CD (APY locked). We're the former.

---

### What's compounding and why does it matter?

**Compounding:** Earning yields on your yields (interest on interest).

**How it works:**
```
Day 1: 1,000 MUSD (principal)
Day 2: 1,000.41 MUSD (earned 0.41 yield)
Day 3: 1,000.82 MUSD (earned 0.41 on 1,000.41, not 1,000)
Day 4: 1,001.23 MUSD (earned 0.41 on 1,000.82)
```

**Continuous compounding (every 5 seconds):**
- KhipuVault compounds every block
- Most platforms compound daily/weekly
- More frequent = higher returns

**Impact over time (15% APY):**

| Period | Without Compounding | With Compounding | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 year | 1,150 MUSD | 1,161.83 MUSD | +11.83 |
| 5 years | 1,750 MUSD | 2,117.00 MUSD | +367.00 |
| 10 years | 2,500 MUSD | 4,481.69 MUSD | +1,981.69 |

**Starting with 1,000 MUSD:**

<Callout type="success">
**The magic:** After 10 years, compounding adds **79% more** to your balance than simple interest. This is why you should never withdraw unless necessary!
</Callout>

## Fees & Costs

### What fees does KhipuVault charge?

**Performance fee:** 10% of yields only

**All other fees:** $0

| Fee Type | Rate | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Management fee | 0% | $0 (never charged) |
| Deposit fee | 0% | $0 per deposit |
| Withdrawal fee | 0% | $0 per withdrawal |
| Performance fee | 10% | $10 on $100 yield |
| Annual fee | 0% | $0 per year |

**Example calculation:**
```
Deposit: 10,000 MUSD
Gross yields (1 year): 1,667 MUSD (16.67% gross APY)
Platform fee: 167 MUSD (10% of 1,667)
Your net yields: 1,500 MUSD (15% net APY)

What you see: 15% APY (already net of fees)
What you pay: 167 MUSD (automatically deducted)
```

**Simple rule:** If you earn $100 in yields, we take $10, you keep $90. If you earn $0, we take $0.

---

### What about gas fees?

Gas fees are paid to Mezo blockchain validators (not KhipuVault):

| Action | Gas Cost (BTC) | Gas Cost (USD) | Frequency |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Approve MUSD | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | One-time per pool |
| Create pool | ~0.0002 | ~$0.02 | One-time |
| Deposit | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | Per deposit |
| Withdraw | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | Per withdrawal |

**Example (first year):**
```
Setup: $0.03 (one-time)
Weekly deposits (52): $0.52
Quarterly withdrawals (4): $0.04
Total: $0.59 for entire year

On $5,000 deposited: 0.01% fee
Compare to bank wire: $20-30 per transfer!
```

**Gas optimization:**
- Batch deposits (weekly/monthly, not daily)
- Minimize withdrawals
- Deposit during off-peak hours (lower congestion)

[Gas optimization guide →](/docs/products/individual-savings/deposits-withdrawals#gas-fees-explained)

---

### How does KhipuVault compare to other platforms?

| Platform | Net APY | Management Fee | Performance Fee | Total Cost |
|----------|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| **KhipuVault** | **15%** | **0%** | **10%** | **Low** |
| Yearn Finance | 12% | 2% | 20% | High |
| Aave (direct) | 8% | 0% | 0% | Medium (gas) |
| Compound (direct) | 10% | 0% | 0% | Medium (gas) |
| Traditional bank | 0.5% | Hidden | Hidden | High (spread) |
| Crypto exchange | 3-5% | 1-2% | 0% | Medium |

**Why KhipuVault wins:**
- Higher net yields (diversified strategies)
- Lower fees (0% management)
- Transparent (no hidden costs)
- Automated (no manual claiming, saves gas)

[Add Mezo to MetaMask →](/docs/getting-started/add-mezo-network)

---

### What are the contract addresses?

**Mezo Testnet contracts:**

```
IndividualPool:  0xdfBEd2D3efBD2071fD407bF169b5e5533eA90393
YieldAggregator: 0x3D28A5eF59Cf3ab8E2E11c0A8031373D46370BE6
MezoIntegration: 0x043def502e4A1b867Fd58Df0Ead080B8062cE1c6
MUSD Token:      0x118917a40FAF1CD7a13dB0Ef56C86De7973Ac503
```

**Verify contracts:**
1. Visit [Mezo Block Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
2. Paste contract address
3. Check "Contract" tab for verified source code

**Security:** Always verify addresses before approving transactions. Never trust addresses from Discord DMs or unverified sources.

### How do I verify my pool on-chain?

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Find Your Pool Address

In KhipuVault dashboard:
1. Go to "My Pools"
2. Click on your pool
3. Copy pool address (e.g., `0x7890...def1`)

### Visit Block Explorer

Go to [explorer.test.mezo.org](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)

### Search Your Address

Paste your pool address and press Enter

### Verify Data

You should see:
- Contract creation transaction
- Your wallet as deployer/owner
- All deposit/withdrawal transactions
- Current MUSD balance
- Event logs (Deposited, Withdrawn, YieldClaimed)

</div>

**What to check:**
- ✅ Owner matches your wallet address
- ✅ Balance matches dashboard
- ✅ Transaction history matches your records
- ✅ Contract is verified (green checkmark)

---

### Can I interact directly with the smart contract?

**Yes!** This is the beauty of blockchain - you don't need KhipuVault's UI.

**Use cases:**
- KhipuVault website is down
- You prefer programmatic access
- Building your own interface
- Emergency withdrawal

**How to deposit via block explorer:**

```solidity
1. Go to explorer.test.mezo.org
2. Find your pool contract
3. Click "Contract" → "Write Contract"
4. Connect wallet
5. Call deposit(amount)
   amount: 1000000000000000000000 (1,000 MUSD in wei)
6. Confirm transaction
```

**How to withdraw:**

```solidity
Call withdraw(amount)
amount: Use getBalance() first to see available
```

**Developer docs:** [Smart contract API reference →](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/individual-pool)

---

### What happens if KhipuVault shuts down?

**Your funds are safe!** Here's why:

**Smart contracts are permissionless:**
- Live on blockchain (not KhipuVault servers)
- Can't be shut down by KhipuVault
- Accessible via any Ethereum-compatible interface

**What you can still do:**
- ✅ Withdraw funds via block explorer (see above)
- ✅ View balance on-chain
- ✅ Transfer to another wallet
- ✅ Yields keep accruing (automated)

**Backup access methods:**
1. **Block explorer:** explorer.test.mezo.org
2. **Etherscan-like tools:** Read/write contracts directly
3. **Web3 libraries:** ethers.js, web3.py (for developers)
4. **Alternative frontends:** Anyone can build a UI for our contracts

**Real example:** If KhipuVault.com goes offline, community can deploy alternative frontend in hours using our open-source code.

<Callout type="success">
**Decentralization benefit:** Your money is in code, not KhipuVault's bank account. Code doesn't care if the company exists.
</Callout>

## Strategy & Usage

### Should I keep funds in one pool or create multiple?

**Most users:** One pool is enough

**Create multiple pools if:**
- Different goals (emergency, vacation, retirement)
- Different time horizons (short vs long-term)
- Different risk preferences (conservative vs aggressive)
- Separating personal vs business savings

**Example multi-pool strategy:**
```
Pool 1: "Emergency Fund" (10,000 MUSD, never withdraw)
Pool 2: "House Down Payment" (target 50,000 MUSD, 2 years)
Pool 3: "Fun Money" (5,000 MUSD, withdraw yields quarterly)

Benefits:
- Clear goal tracking
- Mental accounting (discipline)
- Different withdrawal strategies per pool
```

**Drawbacks:**
- Each pool costs ~$0.02 to create
- More complexity to manage
- Same yields regardless (no benefit from multiple pools)

**Recommendation:** Start with one pool. Add more as your strategy evolves.

---

### How much should I deposit?

**Conservative approach (recommended for beginners):**
```
Step 1: Emergency fund first
  Keep 3-6 months expenses in traditional bank
  Don't touch this (true emergency only)

Step 2: Test KhipuVault
  Deposit 1-5% of savings (e.g., $500 on $10,000 savings)
  Monitor for 1-3 months

Step 3: Scale up gradually
  If comfortable, deposit 10-30% of savings
  Keep rest diversified (stocks, bonds, bank)

Step 4: Ongoing deposits
  Allocate 5-10% of monthly income to KhipuVault
  Automate via weekly DCA
```

**Aggressive approach (for risk-tolerant):**
```
Deposit 50-70% of liquid savings
Keep 30-50% in other assets (diversification)
Add 20-30% of monthly income

Example on $50,000 savings:
  KhipuVault: $30,000 (60%)
  Stocks: $10,000 (20%)
  Traditional bank: $10,000 (20%)
```

**Never do this:**
- ❌ Deposit money you need in < 6 months
- ❌ Deposit emergency fund (keep liquid)
- ❌ Go all-in (100% of savings)
- ❌ Borrow money to deposit (high risk)

[DCA strategies →](/docs/products/individual-savings/strategies#dollar-cost-averaging-dca)

---

### When should I withdraw?

**Good reasons to withdraw:**
- ✅ Reached savings goal (house down payment, car, etc.)
- ✅ True emergency (medical, job loss)
- ✅ Portfolio rebalancing (shift to other investments)
- ✅ Major life change (need liquidity)

**Bad reasons to withdraw:**
- ❌ APY dropped 1-2% temporarily
- ❌ Crypto market down (yields are in MUSD, not volatile)
- ❌ Saw a shiny new DeFi protocol (grass is always greener)
- ❌ Bored (impulse decision)

**Withdrawal strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Never withdraw (maximum compounding)**
```
Let principal grow forever
Withdraw yields only in retirement
Best for: Long-term wealth building
```

**Strategy 2: Goal-based withdrawal**
```
Withdraw when goal is reached
Example: Save 20k for car, withdraw all at 20k
Best for: Specific purchases
```

**Strategy 3: Yield harvesting**
```
Withdraw yields quarterly/annually
Keep principal intact
Best for: Passive income
```

**Strategy 4: Percentage rule**
```
Only withdraw if balance > 150% of goal
Example: Goal 10k, withdraw when balance hits 15k
Best for: Building buffer
```

[Withdrawal strategies guide →](/docs/products/individual-savings/strategies#withdrawal-strategies)

### Can I schedule automatic deposits?

**Not yet, but coming soon!**

**Current workaround:**
- Set calendar reminders (weekly/monthly)
- Use MetaMask scheduled transactions (if supported)
- Manual deposits (takes 30 seconds)

**Planned feature (Q2 2026):**
```
Recurring Deposits:
  Frequency: Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly
  Amount: Fixed (e.g., 100 MUSD/week)
  Source: Your wallet (auto-pull)
  Start date: Customizable
  End date: Optional

Example:
  Deposit 100 MUSD every Monday
  Starting: Feb 10, 2026
  Ending: Never (continuous)
```

**How it will work:**
1. Approve MUSD spending (one-time)
2. Set up schedule in dashboard
3. Smart contract auto-executes deposits
4. You just top up wallet with MUSD as needed

**Join waitlist:** We'll notify you when this launches. Request in [Discord #feature-requests](https://discord.gg/khipuvault)

---

## Troubleshooting

### My transaction failed. What do I do?

**Common causes and solutions:**

**Error: "Insufficient funds for gas"**
```
Problem: Not enough BTC to pay gas fee
Solution: Get BTC from Mezo faucet
  1. Visit https://faucet.test.mezo.org
  2. Paste your wallet address
  3. Request 0.001 BTC (enough for ~10 transactions)
```

**Error: "Insufficient MUSD balance"**
```
Problem: Trying to deposit more than you have
Solution:
  1. Check MUSD balance in MetaMask
  2. Reduce deposit amount
  3. Or get more MUSD from faucet
```

**Error: "Transaction reverted"**
```
Problem: Smart contract rejected transaction
Possible causes:
  - Wrong network (use Mezo Testnet, not Ethereum)
  - Pool doesn't exist (check address)
  - Amount = 0 (enter an amount)
Solution: Check network and try again
```

**Error: "Nonce too high"**
```
Problem: MetaMask nonce sync issue
Solution:
  1. MetaMask → Settings → Advanced
  2. Click "Reset Account"
  3. This clears nonce, keeps wallet intact
  4. Try transaction again
```

**Still stuck?** Share transaction hash in [Discord #support](https://discord.gg/khipuvault)

---

### Why isn't my pool showing in the dashboard?

**Possible reasons:**

**1. Transaction still pending**
```
Solution: Wait 30 seconds to 2 minutes
Check status: explorer.test.mezo.org (paste tx hash)
```

**2. Wrong wallet connected**
```
Solution:
  1. Check MetaMask address (top of extension)
  2. Compare to wallet that created pool
  3. Switch wallets if needed
```

**3. Browser cache issue**
```
Solution:
  1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
  2. Or clear browser cache
  3. Reconnect wallet
```

**4. Indexer lag**
```
Problem: Backend hasn't indexed your pool yet
Solution: Wait 5-10 minutes
If still missing after 10 minutes: Report in Discord
```

**5. Transaction actually failed**
```
Check on explorer:
  - If shows "Failed" → Transaction didn't succeed
  - If shows "Success" → Pool exists, refresh dashboard
```

---

### Yields seem lower than expected. Why?

**Check these factors:**

**1. APY is annual, not daily/weekly**
```
15% APY = 1.25% per month = 0.29% per week
Don't expect 15% after 1 week!

Calculator:
  Deposit: 1,000 MUSD
  Time: 1 week (7 days)
  Expected yield: 1,000 × 0.15 × (7/365) = 2.88 MUSD
```

**2. Displayed APY is recent average**
```
Dashboard shows: "15% APY (last 7 days)"
If you deposited during low APY week (13%), your actual yield will be lower
Check: Historical APY chart for your deposit date
```

**3. Platform fee already deducted**
```
Displayed: 15% APY (net of 10% fee)
Gross APY: 16.67%
If you calculated using 16.67%, that's before fees
```

**4. Compounding takes time**
```
Day 1: Minimal compounding effect
Week 1: Small compounding effect
Month 1: Noticeable compounding
Year 1: Significant compounding

Be patient! Compounding accelerates over time.
```

**5. APY fluctuated downward**
```
Deposited when APY was 17%
APY dropped to 13% this week
Your yield reflects current rate (13%), not deposit rate (17%)
This is normal - APY is variable
```

**Verify your actual yield:**
```
1. Check transaction history
2. Sum all deposits (principal)
3. Compare to current balance
4. Difference = yields earned
5. Calculate your actual APY: (yields / principal) × (365 / days held)
```

### Can I transfer my pool to another wallet?

**No, pools are non-transferable by design.**

**Why?**
- Security: Prevents accidental transfers
- Tax clarity: Clear ownership for reporting
- Safety: Can't be stolen via approval exploit

**Workaround if you want to change wallets:**

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Withdraw from old pool

Use your current wallet to withdraw all funds (principal + yields)

### Create new pool

Connect new wallet and create a fresh pool

### Deposit to new pool

Transfer MUSD to new wallet, then deposit

</div>

**Costs:**
- Withdraw gas: ~$0.01
- Transfer MUSD: ~$0.005
- Create pool: ~$0.02
- Deposit: ~$0.01
- Total: ~$0.045

**When to do this:**
- You lost access to old wallet (use seed phrase to recover first!)
- Upgrading to hardware wallet (good idea for large balances)
- Consolidating multiple wallets

<Callout type="danger">
**Never lose your seed phrase!** If you lose it, your pool is gone forever. We can't recover it.

Write down seed phrase on paper, store in safe. Never digital, never cloud.
</Callout>

---

## Security & Privacy

### Is my balance private?

**Partially private:**

**Public on blockchain:**
- ✅ Your pool address (e.g., `0x7890...def1`)
- ✅ Your transaction history (deposits, withdrawals)
- ✅ Your balance (queryable on-chain)
- ✅ Timestamps of all actions

**Private on KhipuVault:**
- ❌ Your email (if provided)
- ❌ Your goals/descriptions
- ❌ Your real identity (unless you doxx yourself)

**Who can see what:**

| Info | Blockchain | KhipuVault | Public |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Wallet address | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Balance | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Transactions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Email | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Name | ❌ | If provided | ❌ |
| Goal/description | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

**Improve privacy:**
- Use separate wallet for KhipuVault (not linked to identity)
- Don't discuss holdings publicly
- Use VPN when accessing (hides IP from analytics)
- Don't link wallet to centralized exchange KYC

**Blockchain analysis:** Sophisticated attackers can potentially link your wallet to identity through:
- Exchange deposits/withdrawals
- IP address correlation
- On-chain behavior patterns

**Best practice:** Treat your wallet as pseudonymous, not anonymous.

---

### What if someone gets my seed phrase?

**If seed phrase is compromised, your funds are at risk!**

**Immediate actions:**

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Create new wallet ASAP

Generate fresh wallet with new seed phrase (keep this one secure!)

### Withdraw all funds

From compromised wallet:
1. Withdraw from all KhipuVault pools
2. Transfer MUSD to new wallet
3. Transfer any BTC to new wallet

### Move to new pools

Using new wallet:
1. Create fresh pools
2. Deposit recovered funds
3. Never use old wallet again

</div>

**Time is critical:** Do this within minutes, not hours. Attacker may drain your wallet at any time.

**Prevention is better:**
- ✅ Write seed phrase on paper (not digital)
- ✅ Store in safe or safety deposit box
- ✅ Never share with anyone (KhipuVault will NEVER ask)
- ✅ Don't store in email, cloud, password manager
- ✅ Consider hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) for large amounts

**Scam warning:** If someone DMs you asking for seed phrase, it's a scam. Block and report.

---

### How do I know this isn't a scam?

**Valid concerns! Here's how to verify:**

**1. Smart contracts are audited**
```
Auditors: CertiK (reputable firm)
Report: Available at /docs/security/audits
Code: Open source on GitHub
Verification: Contract source verified on Mezo explorer
```

**2. Code is open source**
```
GitHub: github.com/khipuvault/contracts
Anyone can review: All logic is public
Community scrutiny: Developers can audit
Fork it: You could deploy your own version
```

**3. Team is doxxed**
```
Team members: LinkedIn profiles public
Office: Physical location in [location]
Background: Verifiable work history
Social: Active on Twitter, Discord

- ✅ Auto-compounding (save gas)

Manual portfolio: ~8-9% weighted average

KhipuVault: ~15% APY (automated, diversified)
```

**Time/effort comparison:**
```
Direct DeFi:
  - Research protocols: 2-4 hours
  - Set up positions: 30 mins
  - Monitor daily: 10 mins/day
  - Rebalance monthly: 1 hour
  - Claim yields: Weekly ($0.50 gas each)
  Total: ~10 hours + $25 gas/year

KhipuVault:
  - Deposit once: 2 mins
  - Monitor: 0 mins (optional)
  - Rebalance: 0 mins (automatic)
  - Claim yields: 0 mins (auto-compound)
  Total: 2 mins + $0.03 gas
```

**Recommendation:**

- **$10,000-$50,000:** KhipuVault (unless you're DeFi expert)
- **> $50,000:** Consider both (diversification)
