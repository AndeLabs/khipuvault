### Navigate to Your Pool

1. Go to [khipuvault.com](https://khipuvault.com)
2. Connect your wallet (if not connected)
3. Click **"My Pools"** in navigation
4. Select the pool you want to deposit to

You'll see your pool dashboard:
```
House Down Payment
Balance: 0 MUSD
Goal: 50,000 MUSD (0% complete)
Yields Earned: 0 MUSD
[Deposit] [Withdraw] [Settings]
```

### Click "Deposit" Button

A modal appears with the deposit form:
- **Amount field** - How much MUSD to deposit

To: Your Pool Contract
Gas: ~0.0001 BTC
```

Click **"Confirm"** in MetaMask.

### Wait for Confirmation

```
Processing deposit...
Transaction: 0xabc123...
⏳ Waiting for confirmation (5-10 seconds)
```

**What's happening:**
1. MUSD transfers from your wallet to pool
2. Pool updates your balance
3. YieldAggregator receives funds
4. Funds are invested in yield strategies
5. Yields start accumulating

Adding more funds to an existing pool is simpler (no approval needed):

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Click "Deposit"

Navigate to your pool and click **"Deposit"** button.

### Enter Amount

Type amount or use quick buttons. For example, adding your weekly savings:
```
Weekly deposit: 50 MUSD

```
Deposit 50 MUSD
Gas: ~0.0001 BTC
```

Click **"Confirm"** in MetaMask.

### Done!

Funds added in ~10 seconds. Balance updates automatically.

</div>

## Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Regular deposits smooth out market volatility and build discipline.

### Manual DCA Strategy

**Weekly deposits:**
```
Week 1: Deposit 50 MUSD
Week 2: Deposit 50 MUSD
Week 3: Deposit 50 MUSD
...
Total after 1 year: 2,600 MUSD (52 weeks × 50)
```

**Benefits:**
- Builds savings habit
- Reduces timing risk
- Easier on budget (small chunks)

### Setting Reminders

Since auto-deposits aren't available yet, use:
- 📅 Google Calendar reminder (every Monday)
- 📱 Phone alarm (payday)
- 💌 Email reminder service

<Callout type="info">
**Coming Soon:** Automated recurring deposits via smart contracts. You'll be able to set up weekly/monthly auto-deposits without manual transactions.
</Callout>

## Withdrawing Funds

Access your savings anytime - no penalties, no lock-ups.

### Full Withdrawal

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Navigate to Pool

Go to **"My Pools"** and select the pool you want to withdraw from.

### Click "Withdraw" Button

Withdrawal modal appears showing:
```
Available Balance: 1,150 MUSD
  Principal: 1,000 MUSD
  Yields: 150 MUSD

Withdraw Amount: [Enter amount]
[25%] [50%] [75%] [Max]
```

### Select "Max" for Full Withdrawal

Click **"Max"** button to withdraw everything (principal + yields).

Withdrawal summary:
```
Withdraw Amount: 1,150 MUSD
  Your Deposits: 1,000 MUSD (100%)
  Earned Yields: 150 MUSD (15% return)
Remaining Balance: 0 MUSD
Gas Fee: ~0.0001 BTC
```

### Confirm Transaction

MetaMask pops up:
```
Withdraw 1,150 MUSD
To: YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
Gas: ~0.0001 BTC
```

Click **"Confirm"**.

### Receive Funds

```
✅ Withdrawal Complete!

Amount Received: 1,150 MUSD
  Principal Returned: 1,000 MUSD
  Yields Claimed: 150 MUSD
Time Held: 45 days
Effective APY: 15.2%

[View Transaction] [Close]
```

Funds appear in your MetaMask wallet immediately.

</div>

### Partial Withdrawal

Withdraw only what you need, keep the rest earning:

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Click "Withdraw"

Same as full withdrawal - navigate to pool and click **"Withdraw"**.

### Enter Specific Amount

Instead of "Max", type the amount you need:
```
Available: 1,150 MUSD
Withdraw: 200 MUSD (emergency expense)
Remaining: 950 MUSD (continues earning)
```

### Choose Withdrawal Source

You can specify where to withdraw from:

**Option A: Yields First (Recommended)**
- Withdraw from earned yields
- Preserve principal for maximum compounding
- Example: Withdraw 150 MUSD from yields, keep 1,000 MUSD principal

**Option B: Proportional**
- Withdraw proportionally from principal and yields
- Default option
- Example: Withdraw 200 MUSD (174 principal + 26 yields)

**Option C: Principal First**
- Withdraw from deposits first
- Keep yields compounding
- Example: Withdraw 200 MUSD from principal, keep 150 MUSD yields

<Callout type="success">
**Recommendation:** Always withdraw yields first to maximize compound growth of your principal.
</Callout>

### Confirm & Receive

Same confirmation process - funds arrive in ~10 seconds.

</div>

## Withdrawal Strategies

Different approaches for different goals:

### Strategy 1: Never Withdraw (Maximum Compounding)

**Best for:** Long-term wealth building

**How it works:**
- Deposit regularly
- Never touch the balance
- Let yields compound indefinitely

**Example (10 years):**
```
Initial: 1,000 MUSD
Monthly deposits: 100 MUSD
APY: 15% (compounded)
After 10 years: ~31,500 MUSD
  Deposits: 13,000 MUSD
  Yields: 18,500 MUSD
```

### Strategy 2: Withdraw Yields, Keep Principal

**Best for:** Passive income seekers

**How it works:**
- Build up principal (e.g., 10,000 MUSD)
- Withdraw yields monthly/quarterly
- Never touch principal

**Example:**
```
Principal: 10,000 MUSD
Monthly yield: ~125 MUSD (15% APY)
Annual income: ~1,500 MUSD
Principal after 5 years: Still 10,000 MUSD
```

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Withdraw Some, Keep Some)

**Best for:** Balanced approach

**How it works:**
- Withdraw 50% of yields
- Reinvest 50% of yields
- Grow principal while enjoying returns

**Example:**
```
Principal: 5,000 MUSD
Quarterly yield: ~187 MUSD
Withdraw: 93 MUSD
Reinvest: 94 MUSD
After 1 year: Principal grows to ~5,375 MUSD
```

### Strategy 4: Goal-Based Withdrawal

**Best for:** Specific savings goals

**How it works:**
- Set a goal (e.g., $10k for car down payment)
- Deposit until goal is reached
- Withdraw full amount when needed

**Example:**
```
Goal: 10,000 MUSD for car down payment
Monthly deposit: 400 MUSD
With 15% APY: Reach goal in 23 months (vs 25 months at 0%)
Withdraw: Full 10,000 MUSD when ready to buy
```

## Gas Fees Explained

Every blockchain transaction costs gas. Here's what you'll pay:

### Fee Breakdown

| Action | Gas Cost (BTC) | Gas Cost (USD) | Frequency |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| First Deposit (Approve) | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | One-time per pool |
| First Deposit (Transfer) | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | One-time per pool |
| Subsequent Deposits | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | Each deposit |
| Withdrawals | ~0.0001 | ~$0.01 | Each withdrawal |

**Example Cost (First Year):**
```
Initial deposit: $0.02 (approve + deposit)
Weekly deposits (52): $0.52 (52 × $0.01)
Yearly withdrawal: $0.01
Total gas: $0.55

On $2,600 deposited: 0.02% fee
Compare to bank wire fees: $20-30 per transfer!
```

### Gas Optimization Tips

<Callout type="success" title="Save on Gas Fees">
✅ **DO:**
- Batch deposits (one larger deposit vs many small ones)
- Deposit during off-peak hours (lower network congestion)
- Withdraw less frequently (quarterly vs weekly)
- Use "Max" button to avoid dust (tiny amounts left behind)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Make tiny deposits (gas fee % too high)
- Withdraw and re-deposit frequently (wasteful)
- Rush transactions during high congestion
</Callout>

### When Gas Fees Spike

During network congestion, gas can increase 2-5x:

**Normal:** ~0.0001 BTC
**Congested:** ~0.0003-0.0005 BTC

**What to do:**
1. Check [Mezo Gas Tracker](https://explorer.test.mezo.org/gas)
2. If fees are high, wait 30-60 minutes
3. Transactions aren't urgent - yields keep accruing
4. Set a gas limit in MetaMask (advanced)

## Transaction Limits

Understanding minimums and maximums:

### Minimum Deposit

**10 MUSD** per deposit

**Why?**
- Gas fees become too expensive on smaller amounts
- Example: $0.01 gas on $5 deposit = 0.2% fee (too high)
- On $10 deposit = 0.1% fee (acceptable)

### Maximum Deposit

**No hard maximum**, but consider:

| Amount | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| < 10,000 MUSD | Deposit freely |
| 10,000 - 50,000 MUSD | Consider splitting across pools |
| 50,000 - 100,000 MUSD | Contact support for optimal strategy |
| > 100,000 MUSD | Institutional account recommended |

**Why limits matter:**
- Larger deposits may require custom yield strategies
- Risk management (don't put all eggs in one basket)
- Smart contract capacity planning

### Minimum Withdrawal

**No minimum** - withdraw any amount (even 1 MUSD if you want)

**But consider:**
- Gas fee is ~$0.01 regardless of amount
- Withdrawing $1 means 1% goes to gas
- Withdrawing $100 means 0.01% goes to gas

**Recommendation:** Withdraw at least 100 MUSD to keep gas fees < 0.01% of transaction.

## Viewing Transaction History

Track all your deposits and withdrawals:

### In KhipuVault Dashboard

Navigate to **"My Pools"** → **"Transaction History"**:

```
Date          Action      Amount        Balance    Tx Hash
2026-01-15    Deposit     1,000 MUSD    1,000      0xabc...
2026-01-22    Deposit     100 MUSD      1,100      0xdef...
2026-02-01    Yield       18 MUSD       1,118      Auto
2026-02-05    Withdraw    200 MUSD      918        0x123...
```

**Export options:**
- CSV download (for accounting)
- PDF report (for taxes)
- JSON (for developers)

### On Blockchain Explorer

For full transparency, view on-chain:

1. Go to [Mezo Block Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)
2. Paste your pool address: `0x7890...def1`
3. Click **"Transactions"** tab

You'll see every interaction:
- Token transfers (deposits/withdrawals)
- Contract calls (createPool, deposit, withdraw)
- Event emissions (Deposited, Withdrawn, YieldClaimed)
- Gas paid for each transaction

**Example transaction:**
```
Tx Hash: 0xabc123...
Block: 1234567
From: YOUR_WALLET
To: POOL_CONTRACT
Value: 1,000 MUSD
Function: deposit(uint256)
Gas: 0.0001 BTC
Status: ✅ Success
```

## Emergency Withdrawals

If something goes wrong or you need urgent access:

### Standard Emergency Withdrawal

If the platform is down but blockchain is running:

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Go to Block Explorer

Visit [Mezo Block Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org)

### Find Your Pool Contract

Paste your pool address in search.

### Navigate to "Write Contract"

Click **"Contract"** tab → **"Write Contract"** → **"Connect Wallet"**

### Call withdraw() Function

```
Function: withdraw(uint256 amount)
Parameters: 1150000000000000000000 (1,150 MUSD in wei)
```

Click **"Write"** and confirm in MetaMask.

</div>

<Callout type="warning">
**Use this only if:**
- KhipuVault website is inaccessible
- You need urgent withdrawal during downtime
- Standard withdrawal isn't working

This is a backup method. The UI is much easier!
</Callout>

### Smart Contract Paused

If contracts are paused (emergency only):

```
function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyOwner
```

This bypasses normal withdrawal logic and returns all your funds. Only callable by you (the pool owner).

**When would this happen?**
- Critical bug discovered
- Network attack detected
- Upgrade in progress

You'll be notified via email/Discord if this ever occurs.

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient MUSD Balance"

**Error:** Can't deposit because you don't have enough MUSD

**Solution:**
1. Check your MetaMask MUSD balance
2. Get more MUSD from [faucet](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)
3. Or deposit a smaller amount

### "Insufficient BTC for Gas"

**Error:** Not enough BTC to pay gas fees

**Solution:**
1. Get BTC from [Mezo Faucet](https://faucet.test.mezo.org)
2. You need at least 0.0005 BTC for multiple transactions
3. 0.001 BTC is recommended for comfort

### "Allowance Exceeded"

**Error:** Trying to deposit more than approved amount

**Solution:**
1. This shouldn't happen with "unlimited" approval
2. If it does, revoke approval in MetaMask
3. Re-approve when depositing

**How to revoke:**
- MetaMask → Assets → MUSD → "Revoke all"
- Next deposit will request approval again

### Transaction Pending Forever

**Issue:** Transaction stuck for greater than 5 minutes

**Solution:**
1. Check [Mezo Explorer](https://explorer.test.mezo.org) with your tx hash
2. If "pending", it's stuck in mempool
3. Try speeding up (MetaMask → Activity → Speed Up)
4. Or wait - it will eventually confirm or fail

### Withdrawal Not Received

**Issue:** Withdrawal confirmed but MUSD not in wallet

**Solution:**
1. Check MUSD is added to MetaMask (custom token)
2. Verify transaction on block explorer
3. Refresh MetaMask (close and reopen)
4. Check correct network (Mezo Testnet)
5. If still missing after 10 minutes, contact support with tx hash

## Best Practices

<Callout type="success" title="Deposit & Withdrawal Tips">
**Deposits:**
- ✅ Start with small amount (100-500 MUSD) to test
- ✅ Set up regular deposits (DCA strategy)
- ✅ Deposit during off-peak hours (lower gas)
- ✅ Keep some MUSD in wallet for emergencies

**Withdrawals:**
- ✅ Withdraw yields first (keep principal compounding)
- ✅ Plan withdrawals ahead (avoid panic selling)
- ✅ Minimize withdrawal frequency (save on gas)
- ✅ Always verify recipient address (your wallet)

**General:**
- ✅ Keep transaction receipts for taxes
- ✅ Monitor your balance regularly
- ✅ Set price alerts (if MUSD depegs)
- ✅ Diversify across multiple pools if balance > $10k
