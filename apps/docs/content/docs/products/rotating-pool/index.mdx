# Rotating Pool (ROSCA/Pasanaku)

Bring the centuries-old tradition of community savings to blockchain. Create or join a rotating pool where members contribute regularly and take turns receiving the total pot.

## What is a Rotating Pool?

A Rotating Pool is the blockchain version of traditional savings circles known by many names worldwide:

- **Tanda** (Mexico, Central America)
- **Pasanaku** (Bolivia, Peru)
- **ROSCA** (Rotating Savings and Credit Association - global)
- **Cundina** (Peru, Ecuador)
- **San** (Colombia)

**How it works:**
```
10 members × $100/month = $1,000 pot
↓
Month 1 → Member A receives $1,000
Month 2 → Member B receives $1,000
Month 3 → Member C receives $1,000
...continues until everyone has received once
```
