## Understanding Your Payout

### Base Payout Calculation

```
Members: 10
Contribution per member: 100 MUSD
Base pot: 10 × 100 = 1,000 MUSD
```

### Enhanced with Yields

<Callout type="success">
**Bonus: Contributions earn yields while held in the pool.**

The longer funds sit before distribution, the more yields accumulate.
</Callout>

**Example calculation:**

```
Base pot: 1,000 MUSD
Holding period: 7 days average
Yield rate: 12% APY → ~0.23% per week
Yields earned: 1,000 × 0.23% = 2.30 MUSD

Yields after platform fee (10%):
2.30 × 0.90 = 2.07 MUSD

Final payout: 1,000 + 2.07 = 1,002.07 MUSD
```

**Factors affecting yield amount:**

1. **Position in rotation**
   - Early recipients (Round 1-3): Lower yields (less time)
   - Middle recipients (Round 4-7): Moderate yields
   - Late recipients (Round 8-10): Higher yields (more time)

2. **Market conditions**
   - APY fluctuates: 10-18% typically
   - Bull markets: Higher yields
   - Bear markets: Lower yields

3. **Pool size**
   - Larger pots → More absolute yield
   - 10 members × $100 = $2-3 yields
   - 20 members × $100 = $4-6 yields

### Collateral Return

If the pool required collateral, you receive it back with your payout:

```
Payout Breakdown:

Current round pot: 1,002.07 MUSD
+ Your collateral: 500.00 MUSD
───────────────────────────────
Total received: 1,502.07 MUSD
```

<Callout type="info">
**Why collateral is returned:**

You deposited collateral to protect the pool in case you received early and then defaulted. Once you receive your payout, you still owe future contributions, so the collateral is returned as you no longer pose default risk (you haven't been paid yet relative to others).
</Callout>

### Deductions

**Platform Fee:**
```
Only applied to yields: 10% of 2.07 = $0.21
NOT applied to base pot
```

**Late Payment Penalties (if any):**
```
If you were late in Round 3:
Penalty: 5.00 MUSD
Deducted from payout: 1,002.07 - 5.00 = 997.07 MUSD
```

## Claiming Your Payout

### Automatic Distribution (Default)

Most pools use automatic distribution:

<Steps>

### Round Begins

On the scheduled date (Oct 1, 12:00 PM UTC), the smart contract executes.

### Contributions Collected

Contract pulls 100 MUSD from each member automatically.

### Payout Distributed

Contract immediately transfers total pot to you.

```
Transaction: 0xabc123...
From: Pool Contract (0x7a8E9F...)
To: You (0xMnop...3456)
Amount: 1,002.07 MUSD
Timestamp: 2026-10-01 12:00:15 UTC
Status: Confirmed ✓
```

### Confirmation

You receive notification:

```
✅ Payout Received!

Amount: 1,002.07 MUSD
Round: 9
Transaction: 0xabc123...

Your wallet balance updated.
Collateral of 500 MUSD also returned.
```

</Steps>

**No action needed from you.** Just ensure your wallet is accessible.

### Manual Claim (Rare)

Some pools require manual claiming:

<Steps>

### Round Completes

All contributions collected and verified.

### Claim Button Appears

```

```

```

</Steps>

## After Receiving Payout

### Your Ongoing Commitment

**IMPORTANT:** Receiving your payout does NOT end your commitment.

```
You received: Round 9 (October)
You still owe: Round 10 (November)

Remaining contributions: 1 × 100 = 100 MUSD
```

**Full timeline:**

```
Feb-Sep: Paid 8 × $100 = $800 ✓
Oct: Paid $100 + RECEIVED $1,002 ← You are here
Nov: Must pay final $100 ✓

Total paid: $900
Total received: $1,002
Net gain: $102 (from yields)
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't default after receiving!**

This is the most critical time. Some members are tempted to default after getting their payout. Don't be that person. Your collateral was already returned, and defaulting now will:

- Trigger penalties
- Damage your reputation permanently
- Get you banned from future pools
- Hurt your fellow members
</Callout>

### Payment Reminder Setup

After receiving, set strong reminders for remaining contributions:

```
October payout received ✓
November payment (FINAL): Set 3 reminders
  - Oct 25: "Remember final payment Nov 1"
  - Oct 29: "Final payment in 3 days"
  - Oct 31: "Final payment tomorrow!"
```

## Handling Issues

### Payout Delay

**Problem:** Round date passed but you haven't received payout.

**Solution:**
```

2. Contact organizer: Ask for update
3. View contract: Check if funds are ready
4. Manual claim: Try claiming if available
```

### Incorrect Amount

**Problem:** Received different amount than expected.

**Causes:**
1. Late payment penalties applied
2. Market yield changes
3. Missing contributions from members

**Solution:**
```
1. Review breakdown: Check payout details
2. Verify on-chain: Compare with smart contract
3. Contact organizer: If discrepancy found
4. Dispute if needed: On-chain evidence
```

### Wallet Issues

**Problem:** Can't access wallet to receive payout.

**Prevention:**
```
Before your round:
- Backup seed phrase securely
- Test wallet access
- Ensure wallet app is updated
- Have recovery plan
```

**Emergency solution:**
```
If locked out:
1. Recover wallet with seed phrase
2. Contact organizer for delay (if manual claim)
3. Use recovery service if needed
```

## Special Scenarios

### Early Payout (Round 1-2)

**Pros:**
- Get lump sum immediately
- Use for urgent needs
- Start benefiting early

**Cons:**
- Lower yields (less time to accumulate)

**Example:**
```
Round 1 payout: 1,000.50 MUSD (minimal yields)
Remaining payments: 9 × 100 = 900 MUSD
Duration: 9 more months
```

### Late Payout (Round 8-10)

**Pros:**
- Higher yields (more time accumulating)
- Shorter commitment after receiving
- Most members already proven reliable

**Cons:**
- Wait longer for lump sum
- Paid more before receiving
- Slight default risk from early recipients

**Example:**
```
Round 10 payout: 1,015 MUSD (max yields)
Remaining payments: 0 (COMPLETE!)
Duration: Done immediately after
```

### Position Swaps

```
Original: You → Round 9, Member X → Round 4
Swapped: You → Round 4, Member X → Round 9

Member X: Benefits from later position
Both: Sign on-chain swap agreement
```
