# Participating in a Rotating Pool

Join a rotating pool and become part of a trusted savings circle. This guide covers joining, contributing, and staying in good standing.

## Joining a Pool

### Finding Pools

**Option 1: Direct Invitation**
Receive a pool link from the organizer:
```
https://app.khipuvault.com/pools/rotating/42
```

**Option 2: Browse Open Pools**
Explore public pools on KhipuVault:
1. Go to **Rotating Pools** section
2. Click **Browse Pools**
3. Filter by:
   - Contribution amount
   - Schedule (weekly/monthly)
   - Members needed
   - Collateral requirements

**Option 3: Search by Address**
If you have the pool contract address:
```
Enter address: 0x7a8E9F...3B4C
```

### Reviewing Pool Details

Before joining, check all parameters:

```
Pool Information:
├─ Name: Neighborhood Tanda - January 2026
├─ Organizer: 0xAbcd...1234 (verified ✓)
├─ Status: FORMING (8/10 members)
├─ Contribution: 100 MUSD per month
├─ Total Pot: 1,000 MUSD per round
├─ Schedule: Monthly, starts Feb 1, 2026
├─ Duration: 10 months
├─ Collateral: 50% (500 MUSD)
├─ Rotation Order: First-come, first-served
├─ Grace Period: 3 days
└─ Late Penalty: 5% per week
```

**Key questions to ask yourself:**

1. **Can I afford the contribution?**
   - 100 MUSD every month for 10 months = 1,000 MUSD total commitment

2. **Do I have the collateral?**
   - 500 MUSD locked upfront (returned when I receive payout)

3. **Do I trust the organizer?**
   - Check their reputation score
   - See their past pool performance
   - Verify their identity if possible

4. **Does the schedule work for me?**
   - Monthly on the 1st aligns with my payday?
   - 10-month commitment fits my plans?

5. **When might I receive payout?**
   - Join order #9 → Receive in Round 9 (October 2026)
   - Is this timing acceptable?

### Joining Process

<Steps>

### Click "Join Pool"

Review the membership agreement.

### Approve MUSD Spending

Allow the pool contract to pull your contributions automatically.

**Recommended:**
```
Approve: Unlimited (one-time setup)
```

**Conservative:**
```
Approve: 1,000 MUSD (exact total needed)
```

<Callout type="info">
Unlimited approval is safe because the contract can ONLY pull the exact contribution amount on schedule. It cannot pull more or pull early.
</Callout>

### Deposit Collateral

If required, deposit your security collateral:

```
Collateral Amount: 500 MUSD
Purpose: Protect against default after receiving payout
Returned: When you receive your payout
```

Sign the transaction.

### Confirm Membership

```
Member #9 confirmed ✓
Your position: 9 of 10
Your payout round: Round 9 (October 1, 2026)
Next step: Wait for pool to fill and start
```

</Steps>

You're now an official member.

## Understanding Your Position

### Rotation Order

Your position determines when you receive the pot:

```
Rotation Order:
1. 0xAbcd...1234 → Round 1 (Feb 2026)
2. 0xEfgh...5678 → Round 2 (Mar 2026)
3. 0xIjkl...9012 → Round 3 (Apr 2026)
...
9. YOU (0xMnop...3456) → Round 9 (Oct 2026)
10. 0xQrst...7890 → Round 10 (Nov 2026)
```

**What this means:**
- You contribute 100 MUSD every month for 10 months
- You receive 1,000 MUSD in October 2026
- Your collateral is returned with your payout

### Timeline View

```

```

**Net position:**
- Total contributed: 1,000 MUSD
- Total received: 1,000 MUSD + yields
- Plus: Any yields earned on contributions
- Minus: Platform fees (usually 10% of yields only)

## Making Contributions

### Automatic Payments

Contributions are pulled automatically by the smart contract:

```
Due Date: 1st of every month, 12:00 PM UTC
Process: Smart contract calls MUSD.transferFrom()
Your action: Ensure MUSD balance > 100
```

**How it works:**
1. Contract checks if you have sufficient MUSD
2. Contract pulls exactly the contribution amount
3. Contract adds to current round's pot
4. You receive confirmation

### Pre-Funding Strategies

**Strategy 1: Keep Buffer Balance**
```
Maintain: 200 MUSD in wallet
Covers: This month + next month
Refill: Monthly from income
```

**Strategy 2: Auto-Transfer Setup**
```
Set calendar reminder: 28th of each month
Transfer: 100 MUSD from savings to wallet
Ensures: Funds ready by due date
```

**Strategy 3: One-Time Pre-Fund**
```
Deposit: 1,000 MUSD upfront
Let contract pull: Automatically each month
Advantage: No monthly management
```

### Payment Confirmations

After each successful contribution:

```

```

If you pay within grace period, no penalty.

**After Grace Period:**

```

You pay: May 6 (2 days late)

Late penalty: 5% per week
Calculation: $100 × 5% × (2/7 weeks) = $1.43

```

**Escalating penalties:**

```
Week 1 late: 5% penalty ($5)
Week 2 late: 10% penalty ($10)
Week 3 late: Default risk (collateral at stake)
```

## Handling Emergencies

### Temporary Cash Flow Issues

**Option 1: Request Grace Extension**
```
Contact organizer: "May 1 payment delayed 5 days due to [reason]"
Organizer can: Grant one-time extension
Condition: Must have good payment history
```

**Option 2: Borrow from Emergency Fund**
If pool has emergency fund mechanism:
```
Request: Short-term advance from pool reserves
Repay: With next contribution (pay double)
Fee: Small interest (2-3%)
```

**Option 3: Ask Member for Swap**
```
You're scheduled: Round 9 (October)
Member X scheduled: Round 4 (May)
Agreement: Swap positions
Both sign: On-chain position swap
```

### Emergency Withdrawal

If you absolutely cannot continue:

<Steps>

### Submit Emergency Exit Request

```
Click: "Request Emergency Exit"
Reason: [Required explanation]
```

### Pay Exit Penalty

```
Your equity: 300 MUSD contributed
Penalty: 10% = 30 MUSD
Refund: 270 MUSD + collateral (500)
Total returned: 770 MUSD
```

### Organizer/Member Approval

```
Requires: Organizer approval OR 50% member vote
Timeline: 3-5 days review period
Decision: Approve or Deny
```

### Receive Refund

If approved:
```
Refund: 770 MUSD transferred to your wallet
Collateral: 500 MUSD returned
Status: Removed from pool
Impact: Negative on reputation score
```

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
**Emergency exits should be rare.**

Only use if truly necessary. Repeated emergency exits will damage your reputation and make it hard to join future pools.
</Callout>

## Reputation System

### How Reputation Works

Your on-chain reputation score affects pool access:

```

```

### Score Impact

| Score | Status | Access |

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient balance" Error

**Problem:** Smart contract can't pull your contribution.

**Solution:**
```
1. Check MUSD balance: Must be ≥ contribution amount
2. Check approval: Must have approved spending
3. Try manual payment: Dashboard → "Pay Now" button
```

### Missed the Due Date

**Problem:** You forgot to pay on time.

**Solution:**
```
1. Pay immediately: Minimize penalty
2. Contact organizer: Explain situation
3. Set up reminders: Prevent future misses
```

### Can't Afford Contribution

**Problem:** Financial hardship making payment impossible.

**Solution:**
```
1. Contact organizer ASAP: Before defaulting
2. Explore options:
   - Position swap with later member
   - Emergency exit (with penalty)
   - Temporary loan from pool emergency fund
3. Don't ignore: Defaulting is worst option
```

### Dispute with Organizer

**Problem:** Disagree on payment status or pool rules.

**Solution:**
```
1. Check on-chain data: Blockchain is source of truth
2. Screenshot evidence: Transaction hashes, timestamps
3. Request review: Other members or KhipuVault support
4. Escalate if needed: Multi-sig organizers vote
```
