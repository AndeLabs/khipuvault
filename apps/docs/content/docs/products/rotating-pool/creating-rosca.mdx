# Creating a Rotating Pool

Start your own rotating savings pool and invite trusted members to participate. This guide walks through the complete creation process.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

**1. MUSD Balance**
You'll need MUSD for:
- Gas fees (~$0.50 for contract deployment)
- Optional collateral deposit
- Your own first contribution

**2. Member List**
Identify your participants:
- Minimum: 3 members (including you)
- Maximum: 50 members
- Recommended: 5-20 members

**3. Pool Parameters**
Decide on:
- Contribution amount per member
- Payment schedule (weekly/biweekly/monthly)
- Start date
- Collateral requirements (if any)

### Planning Worksheet

Before creating the pool, answer these questions:

```
1. How much can each member commit per round?
   Amount: $_______ MUSD

2. How often will contributions occur?
   [ ] Weekly  [ ] Biweekly  [ ] Monthly  [ ] Custom

3. How many members? (including yourself)
   Count: _______

4. Total pot per round?
   Members × Amount = $_______ MUSD

5. How long will a complete cycle take?
   Members × Interval = _______ weeks/months

6. Require collateral to prevent defaults?
   [ ] Yes, _____% upfront  [ ] No

7. Allow emergency exits?
   [ ] Yes, with _____% penalty  [ ] No
```

## Step 1: Navigate to Pool Creation

<Steps>

### Open KhipuVault Dashboard

Go to [app.khipuvault.com](https://app.khipuvault.com) and connect your wallet.

### Access Rotating Pools

Click **"Rotating Pool"** in the main navigation.

### Start Creation

Click **"Create New Pool"** button.

</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

### Pool Name & Description

```
Pool Name: "Neighborhood Tanda - January 2026"
Description: "Monthly savings pool for home improvements"
```

**Tips:**
- Use descriptive names
- Include time period
- Mention purpose if relevant

### Member Count

```
Number of Members: 10
```

**Considerations:**
- Smaller groups (5-8): Easier to coordinate, faster cycles
- Medium groups (10-15): Balanced, traditional size
- Larger groups (20+): Higher pots, longer cycles

### Contribution Amount

```
Contribution per Member: 100 MUSD
```

**Considerations:**
- Must be affordable for all members
- Consider members' income levels
- Remember: Amount × Members = Total pot each round

<Callout type="info">
**Example Calculations:**

- 5 members × $200 = $1,000 pot every round
- 10 members × $100 = $1,000 pot every round
- 20 members × $50 = $1,000 pot every round

Same pot size, different trade-offs on member count vs. contribution amount.
</Callout>

### Payment Schedule

```
Rotation Interval: Monthly (every 30 days)
```

**Common schedules:**
- **Weekly:** Fast cycles, requires discipline
- **Biweekly:** Matches payday for many workers
- **Monthly:** Traditional, easier to budget

**Start Date:**
```
First Contribution Due: February 1, 2026, 12:00 PM UTC
```

Pick a date that gives members time to join and prepare funds.

## Step 3: Set Rotation Order

### Fixed Order (Recommended)

**Option A: First-Come, First-Served**
```
Order determined by join sequence
Member who joins 1st → Receives Round 1
Member who joins 2nd → Receives Round 2
...
```

Pros: Simple, fair, transparent
Cons: May favor faster joiners

**Option B: Random Lottery**
```
Order randomly assigned on-chain when pool starts
All members have equal chance for any position
```

Pros: Completely fair
Cons: Unpredictable, may not suit planned expenses

**Option C: Manual Assignment**
```
Organizer sets specific order:
Round 1 → 0xAbcd...1234
Round 2 → 0xEfgh...5678
...
```

Pros: Accommodate specific needs (e.g., wedding dates)
Cons: Requires trust in organizer's fairness

**Option D: Member Voting**
```
Members propose order
Requires majority approval to finalize
```

Pros: Democratic
Cons: Time-consuming, potential conflicts

### Bidding Order (Advanced)

Enable bidding for dynamic order:

```
Allow Bidding: Yes
Minimum Discount: 1% (1 MUSD on $100 pot)
Maximum Discount: 15% (15 MUSD on $100 pot)
```

**How it works:**
Each round, members bid a discount to receive early.

Example:
```
Round 1 Bids:
- Member A: 10% discount (receive $900 now)
- Member B: 5% discount (receive $950 now)
- Member C: No bid

Winner: Member A (highest discount)
Member A receives $900, cycle continues
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Bidding complexity warning:**

Bidding ROSCAs work well for sophisticated groups but can confuse traditional ROSCA participants. Stick with fixed-order for cultural authenticity.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Configure Security Settings

### Collateral Requirements

**No Collateral:**
```
Collateral Required: No
```
Relies purely on trust and penalties.

**Partial Collateral:**
```
Collateral Required: Yes
Collateral Percentage: 50%
```
Each member deposits 50% of total pot upfront.

**Full Collateral:**
```
Collateral Required: Yes
Collateral Percentage: 100%
```
Each member deposits full pot value upfront.

**Recommended approach:**

| Trust Level | Collateral |
|-------------|------------|
| Family/close friends | 0-25% |
| Coworkers/neighbors | 25-50% |
| Online community | 50-100% |

### Late Payment Rules

**Grace Period:**
```
Grace Period: 3 days
```
Extra time after due date before penalties apply.

**Penalty Rate:**
```
Late Penalty: 5% per week overdue
```

**Example:**
```
Contribution due: Feb 1
Grace period ends: Feb 4
Member pays on Feb 8: 4 days late = 5% penalty = $5 extra
Member pays on Feb 15: 11 days late = 10% penalty = $10 extra
```

### Default Handling

**Default Threshold:**
```
Missed Payments Before Default: 2
```

**Default Consequences:**
```
1. Collateral slashed to cover missing contributions
2. Member expelled from pool
3. Address blacklisted from future pools
```

### Emergency Exit Policy

**Allow Exits:**
```
Emergency Withdrawal: Enabled
Exit Penalty: 10% of remaining equity
```

**Example:**
```
Member C paid 3 rounds ($300)
Member C hasn't received payout yet
Emergency exit request approved
Refund: $300 - 10% penalty = $270
```

## Step 5: Review & Deploy

## Step 9: Manage Pool

**Payment Tracking:**
```
Round 1 (Feb 1 - Feb 28):

Manual remind: Click member → Send reminder
```

### Dispute Resolution

**If conflicts arise:**

1. **Review on-chain data**
   - All contributions are timestamped
   - All payments are verifiable

2. **Use built-in evidence**
   ```
   Member B claims they paid:
   → Check transaction hash
   → Verify timestamp
   → Confirm amount
   ```

3. **Escalate if needed**
   - Multi-sig organizers vote
   - Emergency pause
   - Refund and dissolve

## Best Practices

### For Organizers

**1. Know Your Members**
- Only invite people you trust or who come recommended
- Verify they understand commitment
- Check they have stable income

**2. Set Realistic Parameters**
- Don't over-estimate member capacity
- Choose affordable contribution amounts
- Allow grace periods for life events

**3. Communicate Clearly**
- Send regular updates
- Remind before due dates
- Celebrate successful rounds

**4. Start Small**
- First pool: 5-8 members, lower amounts
- Build trust and reputation
- Scale up after successful completion

**5. Document Everything**
- Save pool address and ID
- Keep member contact info
- Note any special agreements

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Setting contributions too high**
Members can't sustain payments, defaults increase.

❌ **No collateral with strangers**
High default risk without skin in the game.

❌ **Unclear rotation order**
Leads to disputes and confusion.

❌ **Ignoring late payments**
Small delays compound into major defaults.

❌ **Starting before members ready**
Some members may not have funds prepared.
