# Rotating Pool FAQ

Common questions about participating in and organizing rotating savings pools on KhipuVault.

## General Questions

### What's the difference between a tanda, pasanaku, and ROSCA?

They're all the same concept - rotating savings circles - just with different cultural names:

- **ROSCA** - Global term (Rotating Savings and Credit Association)
- **Tanda** - Mexico, Central America
- **Pasanaku** - Bolivia, Peru (Quechua/Aymara origin)
- **Cundina** - Peru, Ecuador
- **San** - Colombia

KhipuVault supports all these traditions on blockchain with the same smart contract system.

### How is a rotating pool different from other KhipuVault products?

| Feature | Rotating Pool | Individual Savings | Community Pool |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Participants | 3-50 members | Just you | 2+ members |
| Withdrawals | Only on your turn | Anytime | Anytime (with rules) |
| Goal | Lump sum distribution | Flexible savings | Shared savings |
| Commitment | Fixed duration | None | Varies |
| Best for | Planned expenses | Emergency fund | Group goals |

### Is this legal?

Yes. Rotating savings circles are legal worldwide and have existed for centuries. KhipuVault simply brings them on-chain with smart contracts.

However, crypto regulations vary by country. Ensure you comply with your local laws regarding:
- Cryptocurrency ownership
- Tax reporting on yields
- Cross-border transfers (if international pool)

**Always consult a local tax professional.**

### Why use blockchain instead of traditional ROSCAs?

**Blockchain advantages:**
- ✅ Transparent records (no disputes)
- ✅ Automatic payments (no manual collection)
- ✅ Smart contract enforcement (reduced defaults)
- ✅ Global participation (connect diaspora communities)
- ✅ Verifiable history (build reputation)

**Traditional advantages:**
- ✅ No technology barriers
- ✅ Cash-based (no crypto needed)
- ✅ Personal relationships
- ✅ Cultural familiarity

KhipuVault combines the best of both: blockchain infrastructure with cultural tradition.

### What if I don't trust blockchain technology?

Valid concern! Here's what protects you:

1. **Audited contracts** - Security experts verify our code
2. **Open source** - Anyone can inspect the contracts
3. **On-chain verification** - Every transaction is public
4. **No custody** - You control your wallet, not KhipuVault
5. **Tested extensively** - Months of testing on Mezo testnet

Start small: Join a low-value pool first to build confidence.

## Joining & Membership

### How do I find pools to join?

**Three ways:**

1. **Direct invitation** - Organizer shares pool link
2. **Browse public pools** - KhipuVault marketplace
3. **Create your own** - Start a pool and invite members

We recommend joining pools with people you know or who have high reputation scores.

### What do I need to join?

**Required:**
- MUSD balance (for contributions + collateral)
- Compatible wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
- Mezo testnet access

**Recommended:**
- Email for notifications
- Stable income to support contributions
- Understanding of commitment duration

### Can I join multiple pools at once?

Yes! Many users participate in several pools simultaneously:

**Example:**
```
Pool A: $50/week, 8 members, your turn Round 3
Pool B: $100/month, 10 members, your turn Round 7
Pool C: $200/biweekly, 6 members, your turn Round 2
```

**Just ensure you can afford all commitments:**
```
Monthly total:
Pool A: ~$200/month
Pool B: $100/month
Pool C: ~$400/month
───────────────
Total: $700/month commitment
```

### Can I leave a pool after joining?

**Before pool starts:** Yes, easy exit with collateral refund.

**After pool starts:** Only via emergency exit:
- Requires organizer/member approval
- 10% penalty on your equity
- Damages your reputation score
- Should only be done for true emergencies

**After receiving payout:** You MUST complete all remaining contributions. No exit allowed.

### What happens if the pool doesn't fill up?

Organizers set a minimum member threshold (usually 3-5). If not met by start date:

**Option 1: Extended recruitment**
```
Original start: Feb 1
Extended deadline: Feb 15
Minimum members: 5
```

**Option 2: Start with fewer members**
```
Planned: 10 members × $100 = $1,000 pot
Actual: 7 members × $100 = $700 pot
Rotation: 7 rounds instead of 10
```

**Option 3: Cancel and refund**
```
Status: DISSOLVED
All collateral: Refunded
Pool: Cancelled, try again
```

## Contributions & Payments

### How do automatic payments work?

**Setup (one-time):**
1. Approve MUSD spending by pool contract
2. Keep sufficient MUSD balance in wallet
3. Contract pulls exact amount on schedule

**Each round:**
```
Due date arrives → Smart contract executes → Pulls from all members → Distributes to recipient
```

**No manual action needed** unless you run out of MUSD.

### What if I forget to pay?

The smart contract attempts automatic pull. If it fails (insufficient balance):

**Grace period** (typically 3 days):
- No penalty yet
- Reminders sent
- Time to add funds

**After grace period:**
- Late penalties apply (e.g., 5% per week)
- Your reputation score drops
- Risk of default if too late

**Avoid this:**
- Set calendar reminders
- Keep buffer MUSD balance
- Enable email/SMS notifications

### Can I pay early or skip a round?

**Pay early:** No. Smart contract pulls on fixed schedule.

**Pay extra:** Yes, but doesn't skip future rounds.

**Skip a round:** No. Every round requires full participation.

**The design is intentional:** Ensures fairness and predictability for all members.

### What happens if someone else doesn't pay?

**During grace period:**
- Pool waits for late member
- Payout delayed until payment received
- Other members notified

**After default:**
- Member's collateral slashed to cover contribution
- Slashed funds distributed to current round recipient
- Defaulting member expelled
- Pool continues with remaining members

**If no collateral:**
- Pool enters emergency state
- Members vote on resolution:
  - Continue without defaulter (smaller pots)
  - Dissolve and refund remaining equity
  - Organizer covers shortage

### Can I change my contribution amount mid-cycle?

No. All parameters are locked when the pool starts:
- Contribution amount
- Schedule
- Member count
- Rotation order

**Why?** Changing mid-cycle would be unfair to members who already received or planned based on original terms.

**Alternative:** Complete current cycle, then create new pool with different parameters.

## Rotation & Payouts

### How is rotation order decided?

**Four common methods:**

**1. First-come, first-served (default)**
```
Join order 1 → Receive Round 1
Join order 2 → Receive Round 2
...
```

**2. Random lottery**
```
All members assigned randomly on-chain at start
Fair for everyone
```

**3. Manual assignment**
```
Organizer sets order based on:
- Member needs (wedding dates, etc.)
- Consensus discussion
- Community decision
```

**4. Bidding (advanced)**
```
Each round, members bid discount to receive early
Highest bidder wins that round
```

### Can I swap my position with another member?

Yes, if both parties agree and organizer approves:

<Steps>

### Propose Swap

```
You: Round 9 → Want Round 4
Other member: Round 4 → Willing to move to Round 9
```

### Both Sign Agreement

On-chain swap transaction.

### Organizer Approves

Verifies swap is legitimate and fair.

### Order Updated

```
NEW rotation order:
Round 4: YOU (swapped)
Round 9: Other member (swapped)
```

</Steps>

**Why swap?**
- Urgent need for earlier payout
- Preference for later position (higher yields)
- Accommodate life events

### When exactly do I receive my payout?

**Scheduled time:**
```
Round 9: November 1, 2026, 12:00 PM UTC
```

**Actual distribution:**
- Automatic pools: Within minutes of scheduled time
- Manual claim pools: After all contributions verified

**Delays possible if:**
- Members late on payments (during grace period)
- Technical issues (rare)
- Organizer manually reviewing (high-value pools)

**Check dashboard** for real-time status.

### What if I don't receive my payout?

**First, check:**

1. **Pool status** - Is round complete?
2. **Payment status** - Did all members pay?
3. **Wallet** - Is it connected and accessible?
4. **Transaction history** - Was it sent?

**Then:**

```
If sent but not showing:
→ Check Mezo blockchain explorer
→ Verify wallet address
→ Contact wallet support

If not sent:
→ Review payment status of all members
→ Contact pool organizer
→ Check for manual claim button
→ Escalate to KhipuVault support if needed
```

### How are yields calculated on payouts?

**Yield source:** Contributions deposited in pool earn yields on Mezo before distribution.

**Calculation:**
```
Base pot: 1,000 MUSD (10 members × 100)
Holding period: ~7 days average
Current APY: 12%
Weekly rate: 12% / 52 = 0.23%

Gross yields: 1,000 × 0.23% = 2.30 MUSD
Platform fee: 2.30 × 10% = 0.23 MUSD
Net yields: 2.07 MUSD

Total payout: 1,000 + 2.07 = 1,002.07 MUSD
```

**Factors:**
- Position (later = more yield time)
- Market APY (varies 10-18%)
- Pool size (larger = more absolute yield)
- Holding period (weekly vs monthly pools)

## Security & Risk

### What prevents people from defaulting after receiving?

**Multi-layer protection:**

**1. Collateral system**
```
Member deposits: 50% of total pot upfront
Returned when: They receive their payout
Slashed if: They default on future contributions
```

**2. Reputation system**
```
On-chain history of:
- Payment reliability
- Completed pools
- Defaults and late payments

Low reputation = Can't join new pools
```

**3. Social pressure**
```
Pool members know each other
Community accountability
Cultural tradition of trust
```

**4. Legal recourse** (optional)
```
Some pools require identity verification
Can pursue legal action for large defaults
```

**5. Smart contract enforcement**
```
Automatic penalties
Immediate consequences
No escape via disappearing
```

### Is my money safe in the smart contract?

**Security measures:**

✅ **Audited contracts** - Third-party security firms review code
✅ **Open source** - Public verification by community
✅ **Battle-tested** - Months of testnet usage
✅ **Mezo security** - Built on secure Bitcoin-backed blockchain
✅ **No admin keys** - No one can drain funds
✅ **Time-locks** - Protection against exploit attempts

**Risks remain:**
- Smart contract bugs (mitigated by audits)
- Blockchain vulnerabilities (very rare on Mezo)
- Your wallet security (protect seed phrase!)

**Best practices:**
- Start with small amounts
- Verify contract addresses
- Use hardware wallet for large sums
- Never share seed phrase

### What if the organizer is malicious?

**Organizer powers are LIMITED:**

**Can do:**
- Set pool parameters at creation
- Approve emergency exits
- Send announcements
- Pause in extreme emergency

**Cannot do:**
- ❌ Withdraw funds
- ❌ Change rotation order mid-cycle
- ❌ Steal collateral
- ❌ Skip distributions
- ❌ Modify contributions

**Smart contract enforces all critical operations.** Organizer is more like a coordinator than a controller.

**For high-value pools:**
- Use multi-signature organizers (3 of 5 approval)
- Check organizer reputation score
- Require transparent communication
- Verify contract source code

### What happens if KhipuVault shuts down?

**Your funds are safe because:**

1. **Smart contracts are autonomous** - They run on blockchain regardless of KhipuVault website
2. **You control your wallet** - Not custodial
3. **Open source** - Anyone can build alternative frontend
4. **On-chain data** - All records permanent

**How to access:**
```
If app.khipuvault.com goes offline:
→ Use blockchain explorer (Mezo block explorer)
→ Interact directly with contract
→ Community can fork frontend
→ Your wallet still works
```

**Recommendation:** Save your pool contract address.

### Can the government seize my pool funds?

**Technical answer:** Funds are in a smart contract, not a bank account. Harder to seize.

**Legal answer:** Depends on your jurisdiction. Governments can:
- Require reporting of crypto holdings
- Tax yields as income
- Seize crypto in some cases (varies widely)

**Compliance is your responsibility:**
- Report yields on taxes if required
- Follow local crypto regulations
- Consult legal expert if concerned

**KhipuVault is not a bank** and doesn't hold your funds. We provide software tools.

## Fees & Costs

### What fees does KhipuVault charge?

**Platform fee:** 10% of yields only

**Examples:**

```
Example 1: Individual Savings
Deposit: 1,000 MUSD
Yields earned: 120 MUSD (12% APY)
Platform fee: 12 MUSD (10% of 120)
You keep: 1,108 MUSD
```

```
Example 2: Rotating Pool Payout
Base pot: 1,000 MUSD
Yields earned: 2.30 MUSD
Platform fee: 0.23 MUSD (10% of 2.30)
You receive: 1,002.07 MUSD
```

**No fees on:**
- ❌ Deposits
- ❌ Withdrawals
- ❌ Pool creation
- ❌ Contributions
- ❌ Base payouts

**Only on yields**, which are bonus earnings anyway.

### What are the blockchain gas fees?

**Typical costs on Mezo testnet:**

```
Pool creation: ~$0.50
Joining pool: ~$0.10
Contribution: $0 (automatic pull)
Claim payout: $0 (automatic) or ~$0.10 (manual)
```

**Gas fees go to Mezo validators**, not KhipuVault.

**Testnet note:** Currently using test funds. Mainnet fees may vary.

### Are there any hidden costs?

No hidden fees. All costs transparent:

**Upfront costs:**
- Collateral (refundable, not a fee)
- Initial gas for joining

**Ongoing costs:**
- Contributions (go into pot, not a fee)
- Platform fee (10% of yields only)

**No monthly fees, no withdrawal fees, no surprise charges.**

## Technical Questions

### What blockchain is this on?

**Mezo Blockchain:**
- Chain ID: 31611 (testnet)
- Bitcoin-backed security
- EVM-compatible (like Ethereum)
- Fast, low-cost transactions

**Why Mezo?**
- Bitcoin security without Bitcoin fees
- DeFi yields on BTC
- Built for savings applications
- Latin America friendly

### What is MUSD?

**MUSD** = Mezo USD, the stablecoin on Mezo blockchain.

- Pegged to US Dollar (1 MUSD ≈ $1 USD)
- Used for all KhipuVault transactions
- Backed by Bitcoin collateral on Mezo
- Can be swapped for other stablecoins

**Get MUSD:**
1. Bridge from Ethereum/other chains
2. Swap from other Mezo tokens
3. Buy from supported exchanges

### Do I need to keep my wallet connected all the time?

**No.** Your wallet only needs to be connected when:

**For automatic payments:**
- Doesn't need to be online
- Smart contract pulls from your address
- Works even if computer is off

**For manual actions:**
- Creating a pool
- Joining a pool
- Manual claiming payout
- Emergency exits

**Between these actions**, you can disconnect safely.

### Can I use a hardware wallet?

**Yes! Highly recommended for large amounts:**

**Compatible wallets:**
- Ledger (via MetaMask)
- Trezor (via MetaMask)
- GridPlus Lattice

**Benefits:**
- Offline private key storage
- Extra security layer
- Protection from malware

**Considerations:**
- Must connect to approve each transaction
- Slight UX friction (worth it for security)

### What if I lose access to my wallet?

**Prevention (CRITICAL):**
- **Write down seed phrase** on paper
- Store in safe, secure location
- NEVER digital copy (no photos, no cloud)
- Consider metal backup for fire protection
- Test recovery process

**If lost without backup:**
- ❌ Funds are unrecoverable
- ❌ Cannot access pool payouts
- ❌ No customer service can help

**This is blockchain:** You are your own bank. Backup is YOUR responsibility.

**Pool implications:**
If you lose wallet access during pool:
- Can't receive payout (unless you recover)
- Organizer CANNOT reroute to new address (security feature)
- You'll miss your turn

### Can I participate from outside the US?

**Yes!** KhipuVault is global.

**Requirements:**
- Internet access
- Compatible wallet
- MUSD tokens
- Compliance with your local laws

**Popular regions:**
- Latin America (Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia)
- United States
- Europe
- Asia

**Remittance use case:**
Many users create pools with family across borders. Example: Workers in US + family in Mexico in same tanda.

## Cultural & Social

### How do I organize a pool with my family?

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Gauge interest** - Ask family members if interested
2. **Determine parameters**
   ```
   8 family members
   $50/month each
   $400 pot per round
   8 months duration
   ```
3. **Help with wallets** - Assist less tech-savvy members
4. **Create pool** - Set 0-25% collateral (trust-based)
5. **Onboard members** - Walk through joining process
6. **Stay connected** - Family chat for updates

**Cultural tip:** Use traditional names (tanda/pasanaku) to honor heritage.

### Can non-technical people participate?

**Yes, but requires learning:**

**Skills needed:**
- Install wallet app (15 min tutorial)
- Buy/receive MUSD (one-time setup)
- Connect wallet to KhipuVault (simple)
- Monitor notifications (email/SMS)

**KhipuVault makes it easier:**
- Step-by-step wizards
- Video tutorials (in Spanish & English)
- Customer support
- Simple interface

**Organizer role:**
- Help members set up wallets
- Provide ongoing support
- Explain blockchain basics
- Troubleshoot issues

**Reality:** First pool has learning curve. Second pool is easy.

### How do traditional ROSCA participants react to blockchain?

**Common concerns:**

**"Why change what works?"**
→ We enhance, not replace. Keep the community spirit, add transparency.

**"I don't understand technology."**
→ You don't need to understand blockchain internals. Just use the app like online banking.

**"I prefer cash."**
→ MUSD is digital cash. Stable value, works globally.

**"What about people without internet?"**
→ Blockchain ROSCAs are for connected communities. Traditional ROSCAs still valuable for offline groups.

**Success stories:**
- Immigrants staying connected with home communities
- Young generation introducing elders to crypto savings
- Remote workers organizing global tandas

### Can I run a pool for my workplace?

**Yes! Common use case:**

**Workplace tanda example:**
```
15 coworkers
$100 biweekly (payday aligned)
$1,500 pot
Rotation matches annual timing
  - January → Tax season expenses
  - July → Summer vacation
  - December → Holiday shopping
```

**Advantages:**
- See members daily (trust)
- Aligned payday schedule
- Shared culture/community
- Easy communication

**Considerations:**
- Company policy on workplace pools
- Avoid pressure on coworkers
- Handle departures (emergency exit)

### Is this culturally appropriate?

**KhipuVault respects tradition:**

✅ Honors centuries-old practices
✅ Uses cultural names (tanda, pasanaku)
✅ Preserves community spirit
✅ Serves underbanked populations
✅ Enables diaspora connections

**We add value without appropriation:**
- Built by people from ROSCA cultures
- Designed for financial inclusion
- Open to all, not extractive
- Community-focused, not profit-maximizing

**Feedback welcome:** We improve based on community input.

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient balance" error when joining

**Cause:** Not enough MUSD for collateral + first contribution.

**Solution:**
```
Required: Collateral (500) + Contribution (100) = 600 MUSD
Your balance: Check wallet
Need to: Buy/bridge more MUSD
```

### "Approval required" error

**Cause:** Haven't approved pool contract to spend your MUSD.

**Solution:**
1. Click "Approve MUSD"
2. Sign transaction (small gas fee)
3. Wait for confirmation
4. Then join pool

### Can't see my pool on the dashboard

**Possible causes:**

1. **Wrong network** - Switch to Mezo testnet
2. **Wrong wallet** - Connect the wallet you joined with
3. **Pool not yet created** - Check transaction status
4. **Browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Solution:**
```
1. Verify network: Mezo (31611)
2. Verify wallet address matches
3. Search by pool address: 0x7a8E...
4. Contact support if still missing
```

### Payment didn't go through

**Check:**

1. **MUSD balance** - Enough for contribution?
2. **Approval** - Still active?
3. **Gas** - Enough ETH for transaction?
4. **Due date** - Is it actually due yet?

**Retry:**
```
Dashboard → Your Pool → "Pay Now" button → Sign transaction
```

### Payout is less than expected

**Common reasons:**

1. **Late payment penalties** applied to you
2. **Market yields** lower than estimated
3. **Another member** defaulted (pool size reduced)

**Verify:**
```
View payout breakdown:
- Base pot: Expected amount
- Yields: Actual earned
- Penalties: Any deductions
- Fees: Platform fee on yields
```

## Advanced Topics

### Can I create private pools?

**Yes:**

```
Privacy Settings:
- Unlisted: Not shown in public marketplace
- Invite-only: Requires approval to join
- Private metadata: Only members see details
```

**Still on-chain:** Transactions are public, but pool is not advertised.

**Use case:** Family pools, close friend groups, exclusive communities.

### What about bidding ROSCAs?

**Advanced feature** for sophisticated groups:

**How it works:**
```
Round 1 bidding:
- Member A bids: 5% discount (receive $950 now)
- Member B bids: 8% discount (receive $920 now)
- Member C: No bid

Winner: Member B (highest discount)
Members A & C: Keep bidding in future rounds
```

**Advantages:**
- Urgency rewarded
- Market-driven order
- Flexibility

**Disadvantages:**
- Complexity
- Favors wealthy members
- Confusing for traditional users

**Recommendation:** Stick with fixed-order for cultural authenticity.

### Can I integrate pools with other DeFi?

**Current:** KhipuVault pools are standalone.

**Future possibilities:**
- Collateral from other protocols (e.g., deposit Aave tokens)
- Payouts auto-swap to other assets
- Yield from multiple sources
- Cross-chain pools

**Developers:** Open to integrations. Contact us.

### What's the maximum pool size?

**Technical limit:** 50 members (gas efficiency)

**Practical limit:** 15-20 members

**Why?**
- Coordination difficulty
- Default risk increases
- Cycle becomes very long
  ```
  50 members × 30 days = 50 months (4+ years!)
  ```

**Better approach:** Multiple smaller pools or split into cohorts.

### Can I create pools with other assets besides MUSD?

**Currently:** MUSD only.

**Planned:**
- BTC-backed pools
- ETH pools
- Multi-asset options

**Why start with MUSD?**
- Stable value (no price volatility risk)
- Easy yield generation
- Simple accounting
- Familiar (dollar-denominated)
