# What is a ROSCA?

ROSCA stands for **Rotating Savings and Credit Association** - a community-based savings system that has existed for centuries across cultures worldwide. In Latin America, these are known by many beloved names that carry deep cultural significance.

## Names Across Cultures

### Latin America

**Tanda** (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras)
- Most popular in Mexico and Central America
- Name comes from "turn" or "round"
- Often organized at workplaces or neighborhoods
- Typical size: 5-20 members

**Pasanaku** (Bolivia, Peru)
- Quechua/Aymara origin meaning "that which passes"
- Strong tradition in Andean communities
- Often tied to indigenous cultural practices
- Can involve large extended families

**Cundina** (Peru, Ecuador)
- Common in coastal and urban areas
- Often organized among women
- Used for household expenses and emergencies

**San** (Colombia)

- Often includes low-income workers
- Strong social support component

**Vaca** (Various countries)
- Informal name meaning "cow" or "collection"

## How Traditional ROSCAs Work

### The Basic Cycle

```
Example: 10-person tanda, $100/month

Month 1: All 10 contribute $100 → Total $1,000 → Person A receives
Month 2: All 10 contribute $100 → Total $1,000 → Person B receives
Month 3: All 10 contribute $100 → Total $1,000 → Person C receives
...
Month 10: All 10 contribute $100 → Total $1,000 → Person J receives

CYCLE COMPLETE - Can start again with new order
```

### Key Principles

**1. Equal Contributions**
Everyone pays the same amount on the same schedule.

**2. Rotating Distribution**
Each member receives the full pot exactly once per cycle.

**3. Social Contract**
Trust and community pressure ensure compliance.

**4. No Interest**
Traditional ROSCAs don't charge interest (though some variants do).

**5. Community First**
Strengthens social bonds and mutual support.

## Real-World Examples

- Order determined by lottery
- Organizer (senior worker) tracks payments
- Collections happen on payday
- Used for rent, quinceañeras, emergencies

### The Immigrant Pasanaku

**Scenario:** Bolivian community in São Paulo

- 8 families contribute $200/month
- Follows traditional Andean practices
- Meetings include cultural celebrations
- Money used for remittances, education

## Challenges in Traditional ROSCAs

### Default Risk

**The Problem:**
A member stops paying but already received their pot.

**Traditional Solutions:**
- Strong social pressure
- Reputation damage
- Community exclusion
- Personal guarantees from family

**Impact:**
- Studies show 5-15% default rate
- Can collapse entire ROSCA
- Organizer often covers losses

### Trust Dependency

**The Problem:**
Requires knowing and trusting all members.

**Traditional Solutions:**
- Family and friend networks
- Community vetting
- Reputation systems
- Smaller group sizes

**Impact:**
- Limits growth potential
- Excludes newcomers
- Geographic constraints

### Record Keeping

**The Problem:**
Manual tracking of contributions and order.

**Traditional Solutions:**
- Paper ledgers
- Organizer's memory
- Group witnesses

**Impact:**
- Disputes over payments
- Errors in accounting
- No verifiable history

### Organizer Burden

**The Problem:**
One person handles all logistics.

**Traditional Solutions:**
- Respected community member volunteers
- Sometimes small "organizer fee"
- Rotating organizer role

**Impact:**
- Time commitment
- Responsibility stress
- Fraud risk

## Why ROSCAs Persist

Despite challenges, ROSCAs remain popular because:

**1. Financial Access**
Banks don't serve everyone. ROSCAs fill the gap.

**2. Forced Savings**
Regular contributions create discipline.

**3. Lump Sum Access**
Receive large amount earlier than solo saving.

**4. Cultural Trust**
Prefer community-based over institutional.

**5. No Debt**
Get money without formal loans or interest.

**6. Social Capital**
Build reputation and relationships.
