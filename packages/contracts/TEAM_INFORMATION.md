## Time Commitment Details

### Current Status (February 2026)

All 3 team members are **full-time** on KhipuVault:

| Team Member          | Hours/Week | Availability               | Primary Focus                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Ande (Tech Lead)** | 40-60 hrs  | Mon-Sun (flexible)         | Smart contracts, backend, security |
| **Designer**         | 40 hrs     | Mon-Fri (9am-5pm)          | UI/UX, branding, content creation  |
| **Community Lead**   | 40 hrs     | Mon-Sun (7 days, flexible) | Twitter, Telegram, user support    |

### Post-Grant Commitment (Next 6 Months)

With follow-up grant, team commits to:

- ✅ 3 months of full-time work (all 3 members)
- ✅ Mainnet launch & stabilization
- ✅ 24/7 on-call during launch week
- ✅ Weekly progress updates to Mezo team
- ✅ Transparent communication on all decisions

---

## Team Growth Plan

### Short-Term (Months 1-3)

**Current team sufficient for:**

- Mainnet launch
- Initial growth to 100-200 users
- Core feature development
- Community building

### Medium-Term (Months 4-6)

**If growth targets met, consider adding:**

- Part-time QA/Testing specialist
- Part-time LATAM community moderator (Spanish)

### Long-Term (Months 7-12)

**Scale team based on traction:**

- Second developer (if feature velocity needed)
- Dedicated community manager (if community grows to 1,000+)
- Marketing strategist (if pursuing larger campaigns)

**Decision Point:** Only hire when revenue supports it (performance fees from protocol)

---

## Compensation Structure

### Current Model (Bootstrap Phase)

- No salaries paid before grant
- Team working on sweat equity + belief in vision
- Small expenses covered out-of-pocket

### With Follow-Up Grant ($50K)

**Allocation:**

- Team operations: $20K (40% of grant)
- Split equally: ~$6,666 per person for 3 months
- Works out to ~$2,222/month per person (runway, not salary)

**Reality Check:** This is **not** competitive with market salaries. Team is accepting below-market compensation because:

1. Belief in KhipuVault's long-term potential
2. Passion for financial inclusion in LATAM
3. Commitment to Mezo ecosystem
4. Revenue sharing model after protocol is profitable

### Sustainability Plan (Post-Grant)

**Revenue Model:**

- Performance fees: 1-2% of yield generated
- Withdrawal fees: 0.1-0.5% (covers gas)

**Break-Even Calculation:**

- At $50K TVL with 2% performance fee = $1K/year revenue (not sustainable)
- At $500K TVL = $10K/year (covers basic costs)
- At $5M TVL = $100K/year (3 people at ~$33K each + costs)

**Target:** Reach $5M TVL by Month 12 to be self-sustainable

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Burnout

**Mitigation:**

- Realistic workload expectations
- Clear boundaries on work hours (except launch week)
- Weekly check-ins on team morale
- Celebrate wins, learn from losses

### Risk: Insufficient Funding
