# KhipuVault - Executive Summary

## One-Liner

**Bitcoin savings reimagined: Individual yields, group savings, and no-loss lotteries on Mezo.**

## The Problem

- Bitcoin holders want yield but face complex DeFi interfaces
- Traditional savings products exclude the unbanked
- Group savings ("tandas") are informal and trust-based

## Our Solution
